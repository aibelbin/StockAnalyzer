## Earnings Presentation — Q1 FY26

### Q1 FY26 Performance Highlights

Consolidated Performance Highlights of SMC Global Securities Limited

Moneywise, be wise

### Q1 FY26 Margin Profile

(Q-0-Q)

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Revenue | INR 425.1 Crores (23.60% YoY growth) |
| EBITDA | INR 124.8 Crores (+870 Bps YoY growth) |
| PAT | INR 42.4 Crores (+610 Bps YoY growth) |

The Q1 performance reflects a stable revenue trajectory with operational income remaining flat QoQ, though marginally lower YoY due to softer market activity and muted volumes in the broking vertical.

Despite revenue headwinds, cost efficiencies drove a robust jump in EBITDA, with margins improving and PAT margins expanding sharply to 7.1% - highlighting our focus on operational discipline.

We believe this recovery momentum, supported by prudent cost management and an improving market backdrop, positions SMC well to navigate evolving challenges and deliver sustainable profitability going forward.

### Q1 FY26 Consolidated Segmental Performance
