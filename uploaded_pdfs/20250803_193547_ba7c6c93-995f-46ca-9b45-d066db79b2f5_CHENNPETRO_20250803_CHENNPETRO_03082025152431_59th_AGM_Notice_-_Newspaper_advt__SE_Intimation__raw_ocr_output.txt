No complaints yet on Bihar
draft roll from parties: EC

Commission to issue new EPIC cards to electors after special revision of rolls; it opens special

camps to help people file objections, and shares list of excluded names with political parties

Sreeparna Chakrabarty
NEW DELHI

day after the publi-
ye of the draft
electoral rolls fol-

lowing the special inten-
sive revision (SIR) in Bihar,
the Election Commission
on Saturday said all eligible
voters would be given new
elector photo identity
cards (EPIC). Hence, they
should provide new photo-
graphs by September 1
when the deadline to file
claims and _ objections
ends, it said.

The commission said
that in the 24 hours - from
3 p.m. on Friday to 3 p.m.
on Saturday — since the pu-
blication of the draft rolls,
no claims were filed by pol-
itical parties regarding in-
clusion in, or exclusion
from, the rolls.

By the draft rolls, the
number of voters in Bihar
had dropped by 65 lakh
from those on the electoral
list prior to the revision.

The draft rolls of the

Bihar had dropped by 65 lakh. SHASHI SHEKHAR KASHYAP

90,712 polling booths in all
243 Assembly constituen-
cies and the list of those
electors whose names
were present on the electo-
ral rolls till June 24 but not
there on the draft have
been shared with all the
political parties for verifi-
cation, the EC said in a
statement here.

The 12 political parties
on the ground in Bihar
have 1.6 lakh booth-level
agents (BLAs), nominated

by their district presidents.

Details online
Apart from this, any elec-
tor of Bihar can check his
name on the draft electoral
rolls by filling his EPIC
number directly on the
link https://vo-
ters.eci.gov.in The voter
can also file his claim or
objection for addition or
deletion of his name.

The poll body said that
to make this process easy,

special camps had been
opened in all block-cum-
circle offices and urban lo-
cal body municipal offices
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on
all days up to September 1.
In addition to this, adver-
tisements have been given
in newspapers and on tele-
vision and social media.

A special campaign was
organised on August 1 and
2 for the addition of names
of young electors who
turned 18 or will attain that
age from July 1 to October 1.
As of now, 3,223 young
electors have filled the re-
quisite forms.

The commission has de-
cided to double the annual
remuneration of BLOs, and
also enhanced the remun-
eration of BLO supervisors
involved in the preparation
and revision of electoral
rolls. The last such revision
was done in 2015. Also, an
honorarium has been pro-
vided for electoral registra-
tion officers and assistant
electoral registration offic-
ers for the first time.

Name is missing on draft roll, says
Tejashwi; EC counters with extract

Amit Bhelari
Sreeparna Chakrabart
PATNA/NEW DELHI

Tejashwi Yadav, Leader of
the Opposition in the Bihar
Assembly, raked up a con-
troversy on Saturday, just a
day after the draft electoral
rolls of the State were pu-
blished, saying his name
was missing from the list.
The Election Commis-
sion (EC) said the former
Deputy Chief Minister was
making “baseless” claims,
and furnished the extract
of the draft roll in which
his name is present.
However, confusion pre-
vailed over the fact that the
EPIC (elector photo identi-
ty card) number quoted by
Mr. Yadav was different
from the one which the
commission gave him on
the list it showed. While
Mr. Yadav said he voted in
the Lok Sabha election in
2024 using the voter ID
card having the number
RAB2916120, which is now
missing from the draft
rolls, the EC list shows the
number as RABO456228.
EC sources in Delhi said
that Mr. Yadav had used
EPIC no. RABO456228 for

a

conference in Patna on Saturday. PTI

filing his nomination pap-
ers on affidavit in the 2020
Assembly election and he
was listed with this num-
ber even on the 2015 elec-
toral roll. The sources said
the other EPIC id
RAB2916120 had _ been
found to be non-existent
after checking records of
more than 10 years.

“No records have been
found for the second EPIC
number yet. It is highly
likely that the second EPIC
was never made through
official channel and furth-
er inquiries are on to un-
derstand the reality of the
second EPIC number,
whether that is a forged
document,” a source told
The Hindu.

Both the EPIC cards
bear the same address.

Mr. Yadav is a voter in
the Digha Assembly consti-
tuency and represents the
Raghopur Assembly seat.
In the current draft roll pu-
blished on Friday, his
name is listed in polling
station number 204, Li-
brary Building of Bihar
Animal Science University,
at serial number 416.

Addressing a press con-
ference in Patna, Mr. Yadav
said, “You all can see that
my name is not found on
the EC website. If this is the
thing with the Leader of
the Opposition, then just
think about the common
man. What kind of difficul-
ties they must be facing to

provide the details and to
register their name on the
draft list,’ he said.

Patna District Magis-
trate Thiyagarajan S.M’s
office issued a press state-
ment saying that an investi-
gation was conducted by
the district administration
and it was clear that Mr. Ya-
dav’s name is on the draft
rolls.

The DM’s office also
shared Mr. Yadav’s 2020
Assembly election affida-
vit. “In the Bihar Assembly
Election, 2020, the Leader
of Opposition has men-
tioned the above EPIC
number in his affidavit. It
can be seen at serial num-
ber 511 in the attached elec-
toral roll,” it said.

Despite the clarification,
Mr. Yadav repeated the al-
legation when he attended
a public event in Patna.

“After the chaos, the EC
is saying that my name is
there on the draft list but
the EPIC number is diffe-
rent. EPIC number cannot
be changed and it only
happens when you delete
your name from the pre-
sent State and add it in
another State,” the RJD
leader said.

I was tortured, asked to name Narendra Modi
in Malegaon blast case: Pragya Singh Thakur

Press Trust of India
MUMBAL

Former BJP MP Pragya
Singh Thakur, who was re-
cently acquitted in the Sep-
tember 2008 Malegaon
blast case, on Saturday al-
leged that the officers
probing the case had tor-
tured her and asked her to
name several persons, in-
cluding Prime Minister Na-
rendra Modi.

She claimed she had put
all this in writing.

However, Ms. Thakur’s
claim found no mention in
the 1,036-page judgment of
the special National Inves-
tigation Agency (NIA)
court, which acquitted all
seven accused in the case
on July 31, almost 17 years
after six persons were
killed in the bomb blast in
the north Maharashtra city
on September 29, 2008. It
criticised the probe agency

y)

Former BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur outside a Mumbai sessions
court where she completed her surety formalities. PTI

for presenting what it
called “inconclusive”, “un-
reliable” and “legally inad-
missible” evidence.

The former Bhopal MP
made the allegation while
speaking to reporters out-
side the Mumbai sessions
court, where she complet-
ed her surety formalities.

“They (officers) told me
to take PM Modi’s name, as

at the time I was staying in
Surat (Gujarat),” Ms. Tha-
kur said. She added that
the officers threatened to
torture her unless she
named several persons
such as “Bhagwat (appa-
rent reference to RSS chief
Mohan Bhagwat) and Uttar
Pradesh Chief Minister Yo-
gi Adityanath”.

“But I did not take

anyone’s name as I did not
want to lie,” she told repor-
ters. The BJP leader alleged
that she was detained ille-
gally in a hospital where
she had fainted and her
lungs had collapsed.

“IT am writing my story
in which I will mention all
this. The truth will come
out. This is a victory of reli-
gion, a victory of Sanatana
dharma, and a victory of
Hindutva,” she said.

Notably, special judge
A.K. Lahoti in his July 31
judgment had dismissed
Ms. Thakur’s claims of tor-
ture and ill-treatment, stat-
ing that no evidence was
presented to support her
claims.

The court had also re-
ferred to a Supreme Court
order of 2011 rejecting her
claims of illegal custody,
torture and detention. The
trial court further said that
Ms. Thakur had not made

any complaint when she
was produced for remand
after her arrest.

‘No evidence of torture’
“There is no evidence (of
torture and ill-treatment)
brought to my notice and
hence, I am not inclined to
accept the submission,”
stated the special judge. He
had acknowledged the
“agony, frustration, and
trauma” caused by the fact
that a heinous crime had
gone unpunished.
“However, the law does
not permit courts to con-
vict an accused solely on
the basis of moral convic-
tion or suspicion... The
more serious the offence,
the higher the standard of
proof required. Admitted-
ly, in the present case,
there is no reliable, cogent
and acceptable evidence
on record... to warrant the
conviction,” he said.

EC wants to take away vote
from minorities, says Kharge

The Hindu Bureau
NEW DELHI

Amid the ongoing row over
the special intensive revi-
sion of electoral rolls in Bi-
har, Congress president
Mallikarjun Kharge on Sa-
turday alleged that the
Election Commission had
become a “puppet” of
Prime Minister Narendra
Modi. He added that the
draft voter list published in
Bihar indicated that as ma-
ny as 65 lakh voters could

be disenfranchised.

Mr. Kharge, who was ad-
dressing the All India Con-
gress Committee’s annual
legal conclave here on Sa-
turday, added that the EC
“wants to take away” the
voting rights of all the
poor, marginalised and mi-
norities, who would other-
wise vote for the Congress
as they were “fed up” with
BJP’s rule. “Let them vote
for whoever they want to,”
he said. At the event titled
“Constitutional challenges

- perspectives and path-
ways”, in addition to Mr.
Kharge and Leader of the
Opposition Rahul Gandhi,
senior leaders like Abhish-
ek Manu Singhvi, Priyanka
Gandhi Vadra, and K.C. Ve-
nugopal spoke.

“The soul of India is en-
shrined in the Constitu-
tion. It is the strength of ev-
ery citizen, their right to
move forward and live
with dignity. We will pro-
tect the Constitution at all
costs,” Mr. Kharge said.

BJP deletes
controversial
post on nuns
after backlash

The Hindu Bureau
RAIPUR

A cartoon posted by the
Bharatiya Janata Party in
Chhattisgarh on the social
media platform X which
referred to the controversy
over the arrest of two
Christian nuns in the State,
resulted in a backlash, forc-
ing the party to delete the
post on Saturday.

The cartoon, depicting
Congress leaders such as
Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka
Gandhi Vadra, and K.C. Ve-
nugopal bowing to nuns
and as well-wishers of
those indulging in human
trafficking and religious
conversions, was posted
and deleted in quick suc-
cession on Saturday morn-
ing after some users said it
mocked Christianity.

The deleted cartoon,
too, prompted a strong re-
buttal from the Opposition
Congress in the State. The
party said the BJP had
been forced to delete the
post fearing electoral loss-
es in Kerala.

The nuns hail from the
southern State.
