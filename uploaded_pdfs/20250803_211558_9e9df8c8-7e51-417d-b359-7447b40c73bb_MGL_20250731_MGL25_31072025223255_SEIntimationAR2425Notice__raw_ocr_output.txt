MAHANAGAR

About Our Company

Incorporated on May 8, 1995, Mahanagar Gas Limited (MGL) has evolved
into one of India’s foremost city gas distribution companies, playing a
pivotal role in driving cleaner energy adoption across MMR and Raigad.

The Company supplies Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) to over a million vehicles and delivers Piped Natural Gas (PNG) to residential,
commercial, and industrial consumers, making natural gas an integral part of everyday life in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane, and Raigad.

MGLs operations are fully integrated from planning and Laying pipelines to network management and customer service powered by an
enterprise-wide SAP ERP system that ensures agility, transparency, and uninterrupted service delivery.

As the energy landscape transforms, MGL
has taken bold steps to future-proof its
business. The Company is transitioning
from a traditional city gas distributor into
a diversified energy company, guided by
the belief that clean energy must be both
accessible and scalable.

Strategic acquisitions and partnerships
have been central to this transformation.
The acquisition of Unison Enviro Private
Limited (UEPL) marked a major leap in
MGL’s geographic footprint, taking its reach
beyond the Mumbai Metropolitan Region
(MMR) into Ratnagiri, Latur, and Osmanabad

02

districts in Maharashtra, and Chitradurga
and Davanagere districts in Karnataka. With
this, MGL now serves a broader and more
diverse customer base, while enhancing
its infrastructure presence in underserved
markets.

To address the challenge of carbon
emissions posed by the rapidly expanding
long-haul transport fleet—and recognising
that demand for LNG in this segment must
be developed through ecosystem support
and cost-effective vehicle availability—MGL
has forayed into the Liquefied Natural Gas
(LNG) segment. Through its joint venture with

Baidyanath LNG Private Limited, Mahanagar
LNG Private Limited (MLPL) was established
to build a robust LNG retail network for the
transport sector. This strategic move is aligned
with the national goal of reducing emissions
and expanding access to cleaner fuels.

With a balanced approach of operational
excellence, strategic expansion, and
sustainability-driven innovation, MGL is
redefining its role from being a regional
gas supplier to a national-level clean energy
enabler.

Sandeep Kumar Gupta
Chairman

Dear Shareholders,

Once again, it gives me immense pleasure
to present the Annual Report of Mahanagar
Gas Ltd (MGL) for FY 2024-25, Share insights
of our performance & highlights and to
outline the road ahead.

As you must be aware, global demand for
natural gas experienced a significant rebound
in 2024-25, following a tough couple of
years marked by the global energy crisis.
This heightened demand is primarily driven
by the rapidly expanding economies in Asia

14

and a partial recovery of Natural Gas (NG}
consumption in Europe. However, the supply
side continues to face constraints, with the
growth in LNG production struggling to keep
up with the demand. Geopolitical tensions
exacerbate the situation, contributing to
fluctuating prices and volatility in international
markets though the level of volatility has
reduced in its intensity & frequency. As we
look ahead, the coming years are likely to be
in favour of consumers.

India’s Growing Natural Gas
Market

Within India, the narrative is one of
substantial investments in infrastructure
development leading to consistent
growth, propelled by rapid urbanisation,
a burgeoning middle class and a push
by the GOI to increase the share of NG
to 15% of the energy basket in order to
meet the climate challenges & India’s Net
Zero commitment. Development of the

national gas grid, coupled with the City Gas
Distribution (CGD) network development, is
making natural gas more accessible across
the country. This expanding landscape
offers promising opportunities for both
consumers and industries alike.

Expansion of Natural Gas and
LNG Infrastructure in India

The development of NG infrastructure in
India is progressing at a commendable
pace. 34,233 km of natural gas trunk
pipelines have been authorised by PNGRB
and 25,429 km is already operational &
10,429 km is under construction (including
main and auxiliary pipeline). Even more
exciting are efforts made to connect hereto
unconnected regions like central & Eastern
India which are demanc-rich areas & linking
new domestic supply sources like North East
(NE), with new transmission and distribution
pipelines being laid out across regions. The
NE Gas Grid is emerging as a key part of
this expansion, connecting the north-eastern
states to the broader national network.

In terms of LNG infrastructure, the
commissioning of the Chhara (Gujarat) LNG
terminal added 5 million Metric Tonnes
Per Annum (MMTPA) to the country’s re-
gasification capacity. The country’s total
re-gasification capacity now stands at
52.7 MMTPA. Inauguration of the first
small scale LNG unit by GAIL emphasized
the importance of developing alternative
technologies to meet the customers
demands. Further, ambitious plans are
in place to further expand re-gasification
capacity to 61 MMTPA.

The City Gas Distribution Sector

The CGD sector continues to be the prime
mover for growth in NG consumption.
While the fertiliser remains the largest
consumer at %30%, CGD contribution
has been noteworthy, now representing

The expansion of CNG infrastructure in India has been
noteworthy. As of 31% March, 2025, the country had 8,067
CNG retail stations, registering an impressive YOY growth
of 17.58% demonstrating a significant increase from the
6,861 stations just a year earlier. The expanding CGD
network and the rising number of CNG stations, is steadily
enhancing the appeal of CNG Fuelled vehicles in India.

~20% of the total gas consumption in a
relatively short period. This growth can
be attributed to strong government support
in terms of Domestic Gas allocation &
priority, authorisation of 307 GA’s covering
the length & breadth of the country, rapid
urbanisation, and the dedicated efforts
of CGD companies like your company to
connect more households & commercial
establishment, Industries & fuelling vehicles.

The expansion of CNG infrastructure in

and the rising number of CNG stations,
is steadily enhancing the appeal of CNG
Fuelled vehicles in India.

The other segment of CGD i.e. D-PNG is
also registering growth on YOY. The Total
DPNG connections in the country stands
at “1.5 Cr. and Commercial & Industrial
PNG connections are 45,373 & 20,461
respectively as on 31" March, 2025.

The GOI is also doubling down on the growth
of the Compressed Bio Gas (CBG) by taking
bold policy decisions like SATAT scheme,
Blending Obligations for CGD on one hand &
on other hand giving infrastructure creation

push through lending support as well as
subsidy for pipeline connectivity of CBG
plants with CGD networks.

Performance Highlights

Our Sourcing

Reliable & reasonably priced supplies of
Natural Gas (NG) are a critical component
of our operations. We have been ensuring
this through a diverse sourcing strategy
that includes APM (Administered Pricing
Mechanism), HPHT (High Pressure High
Temperature) gas, term Regasified Liquefied
Natural Gas (RLNG) & Spot RLNG/Domestic

Capitalising on a Supportive
Regulatory Landscape

The regulatory environment continues to
work in MGL’s favour. Your Company holds
the authority to lay, build, operate and
expand CGD networks in Mumbai, Urban
Thane and Raigad district.

The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural
Gas (MoPNG) has continued to prioritise
domestic gas (APM) allocation to CGD
entities. As outlined in the January 13,
2023, notification, CGD entities also enjoy
first-priority status for HPHT gas over other
bidders. Additionally, starting from April,
2023, APM gas prices have been capped at
$6.5/MMBTU, with planned annual increase
of $0.25/MMBTU thereafter.

Moreover, the Petroleum and Natural Gas
Regulatory Board (PNGRB) implemented
a Unified Tariff on July 1, 2023. This has
ensured that transportation tariffs remains
at a reasonable level for CGDs who are
located in far flung ares from the Gas
sources.

Strengthening Core Markets and
Exploring New Horizons

Our growth strategy focuses on staying
adaptable and building on our strengths,
while also exploring new opportunities. Our
expansion efforts include acquisitions within
the CGD sector, allowing us to extend our
footprint and market presence. Parallelly,
we are focusing on the diversification of
our portfolio by investing in high-potential,
emerging sectors that will ensure your
Company's continued growth in a landscape
that is constantly evolving.

You will be happy to note that your
company’s JV, Mahanager LNG Pvt Ltd
(MLPL), has opened its 1% LNG station
in Aurangabad in October 2024, which
is receiving a good response. In March
2025, MLPL technically completed its
2" LNG station in Seoni (MP) on the strategic
Kolkata-Mumbai national highway, very
close to Nagpur. MLPL is expected to add
four more stations in FY26.

FY 25 was the 1" year of operations of Unison
Enviro Private Limited (UEPL) acquired in

Feb 2024. UEPL had started its operation
in 2018 & till Jan 2024 had constructed 53
CNG stations. Post acquisition, UEPL, under
the management of your company not only
added 29 CNG stations till FY 25 but also
managed to increase the Gas volume by
~45%. As on 31% March, 2025, UEPL has
82 CNG stations & is poised to cross 100
stations by FY26, while increasing the gas
sales volume by 2.5 times post-acquisition.

In the space of green mobility, last year
your company invested in 3EV, a startup
manufacturing electric 3W for cargo &
passengers. These Electric 3W’s in the cargo
segment are mainly used by e-commerce
companies for last-mile deliveries replacing
the petrol and diesel vehicles.

Further, your Company took another step
towards clean mobility by forming a JV with
IBC USA for Battery Cell manufacturing in
India. The total investment envisaged in this
JV will be “2350 Cr for a Giga factory in the
tech capital of India, Bengaluru, by 2027.
These two investments by your company
reaffirm our dedication to advancing clean
and innovative energy solutions while
planning for the future.

Leveraging Opportunities as They
Come

We see significant opportunities within our
existing markets and are implementing
targeted initiatives to further penetrate these
markets. As the population continues to
grow in the regions we serve, the demand
for natural gas is expected to rise, and we
are fully equipped to meet this demand. Our
strategy includes expanding our customer
base for both the CNG and PNG Segments.
Raigad district has been identified as a
particularly promising area for growth, and
we are working to expand our network and
attract new customers.

20

Additionally, the increasing availability of
Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)
CNG vehicles is driving growth in the
commercial goods vehicle segment, creating
a promising market that we are keen to tap
into. To make inroads into the CV segment
of CNG, your company this year launched
CNG Mahotsav Il, which resulted in the CV
sales volume growing this year by 17.80%.

Your company has arguably been among
the most innovative PNG marketing
companies in India. In Domestic PNG, MGL
created history by launching a first-of-its-
kind lucky draw on gasified registrations in
November 2024 — March 2025 under the
“KHUSHIYAN LAKHON K? scheme. MGL
also launched special initiatives for unsold
flats lying with builders and flats in the SRA
and low-income group societies.

Your company is also the first to revolutionise
the adoption of gas in the Commercial sector by
undertaking end-to-end responsibility, starting
from obtaining approvals till downstream
connectivity. This is expected to thrust the
number of new commercial connections
several-fold starting FY 25-26 itself.

Driving Automation and Digital Process Excellence

We focus on automation and intelligent systems to streamline operations and elevate efficiency. A notable initiative in this direction
is the Inside Kitchen Activity Mobile App for monitoring safety protocols during Last Mile Connectivity (LMC) work. This digital tool has
replaced manual, paper-based safety checks, streamlining the process and promoting environmental stewardship by eliminating over
1.5 Lakh paper-based permits annually. Its remote audit capabilities have enhanced real-time compliance oversight. Building on this
momentum, we are preparing a structured plan to scale automation across departments to drive cross-functional synergies.

integrated with the grid. This initiative
not only promotes the use of renewable
energy but also provides an additional
revenue stream through the sale of surplus
electricity.

In a recent pilot project, we collaborated
with a vendor to test hybrid solar panels
that is integrated with HVAC system
at our head office. Conducted over a
span of 2-3 months, the pilot showed a
significant reduction in energy consumption.
Encouraged by these results, we are now
conducting a feasibility survey to evaluate
the potential for scaling this technology
across other office locations.

enhances price stability and ensures a
reliable supply. We have established strong
partnerships with major suppliers, including
GAIL, IOCL, BPCL, RIL and others, formalised
through Framework Agreements and Term
Sheets, securing our supply chain for the future.

We also engage and subscribe to
Bloomberg and S&P Global (Platts), which

our supply chain.

To further enhance our supply chain, we issue
monthly tenders for Spot RLNG, either on a
Reasonable Endeavour or Firm basis, allowing
for greater flexibility and cost efficiency.
Our close collaboration with our suppliers
allows us to accurately forecast demand,
plan for seasonal variations and uninterrupted
supply. To streamline operations further, we

Case Study

Initial Implementation

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the project commenced in six villages, including Zap, Aptwane, Wavloli, Bharje, Adulse, and Chikhalgaon.
Self-Help Groups (SHGs) were established to promote financial independence, while Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs) and School
Management Committees (SMCs) were formed to improve school governance and access to government schemes. The sanitation
drive resulted in a decline of 33% in open defecation, while maternal and infant mortality rates dropped by 19% and 8%, respectively

“PRIDE India and Mahanagar Gas Limited have transformed our village by addressing critical issues such as education, health,
water, and sanitation services. Initially, community engagement was challenging, but through persistent efforts, a sense of unity
and cooperation emerged. Today, villagers actively participate in development activities, with women taking leadership roles in
maintaining village cleanliness and attending training sessions. This program has significantly improved our quality of life and brought

positive change to our community. We are deeply grateful for the support that has empowered us to build a better future together.”

Inside India’s Fight Against TB

In the relentless battle against disease,
there are stories of resilience, courage, and
determination. One such battle is against
tuberculosis (TB), an ancient enemy that
continues to be the world’s deadliest
infectious disease, especially in India.

India’s TB story is that of hard-fought battles
with few misses. As per WHO, India accounted
for the highest share of global TB cases, “26%.
leading to “3,23,000 deaths. As expected,
even for Multidrug-Resistant TB (MDR-TB),
India accounted for 27% of global cases
in 2022.

India’s Battle

TB is caused by the Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, primarily affecting the Lungs.
TB spreads through the air when an infected
person coughs or sneezes. Crowded living
conditions, poor ventilation, and malnutrition
exacerbate its spread, whereas densely
populated areas with limited healthcare
access make the risk even higher. India
has declared a determined fight against TB
under the National TB Elimination Program
(NTEP). The country’s efforts are resting on
three main pillars, viz. early diagnosis, free
treatment, and nutritional support.

In Maharashtra, the state government has
amplified the efforts through aggressive
awareness campaigns and active case-
finding missions. Special focus was placed
on high-burden districts & grassroots support
through health workers conducting door-to-
door screenings.

Despite these initiatives, challenges
persisted. Delayed diagnosis, lack of
medication and the stigma surrounding
TB continue to hinder progress. This stigma
often forces patients, especially women
into silence, preventing them from seeking
timely care due to fear of social exclusion
or domestic repercussions.

MGL: A Partner in NTEP

Realising the gravity of the situation, we at
MGL, decided to focus on TB elimination.
As a first step, standing in solidarity with
the NTEP, MGL proudly took the Corporate
TB Pledge.

While studying the scenario in Maharashtra
for TB elimination, MGL did the gap analysis
and decided to focus on two of the three
main pillars, i.e., early diagnosis & nutritional
support, as medicines were being provided
by the government. Recognizing the urgent
need for advanced diagnostic infrastructure
to combat TB, MGL took a significant step
by donating & installing TruNAAT machines
(covered with Annual Maintenance Contract)
at 10 healthcare centres & also ensured
uninterrupted supplies of cartridges. Initially
focused on urban slum populations like
Dharavi, Bandra, and subsequently shifted
focus on TB hotspots like Bhiwandi. These
machineries have played a crucial role in
improving the accuracy and speed of TB
detection, enabling early diagnosis and
timely initiation of treatment, especially in
high-burden areas.

for TB testing

Providing free nutritional support for
patients under Nikshay Poshan Yojana

However, we soon reclised an alternative
strategy for reaching out unreachable but
vulnerable group of people like diabetic
patients, malnourished population, prisoners
group etc., for early diagnosis through
portable X-RAY machines. This not only
reduces the load on TruNAAT machines but
also serves the asymptomatic patients from
distant areas. Hence, MGL subsequently
provided three top-quality ultra-portable X-ray
machines to healthcare centres in far-flung
areas of Thane, Bhiwandi and Alibaug. These
compact devices allow for immediate chest
screening, particularly valuable in remote and
underserved areas where access to diagnostic
infrastructure is limited. By facilitating rapid,
on-the-spot screening, handheld X-rays help in
early identification of TB, reducing diagnostic
delays as well as load on TruNAAT machines,
thereby strengthening overall TB detection. In
FY 2024-25, 26,530 people were screened
through MGL provided 10 TruNAAT machines
and 3 handheld X-RAY machines.

Beyond diagnostics, MGL is deeply
committed to holistic patient care. Proper
nutrition plays a critical role in faster
recovery and improved treatment outcomes,
and MGL is proud to stand alongside TB
patients in their journey toward healing.
Under the Nikshay Mitra Scheme, MGL
extended nutritional support to 400 TB
patients across 10 blocks of Raigad district.

As we move forward, MGL remains committed to
partnering with the government, healthcare providers,
and communities to realize a TB-free India. With
collective resolve, we can achieve our Prime Minister’s
vision of “TB Mukt Bharat,” ensuring healthier lives and
stronger communities for generations to come.

Tuberculosis remains a serious health concern
in Maharashtra and across India. Early testing and
timely treatment are key to stopping its spread.
With rising awareness and strong support from
partners like MGL, we are making greater impact.

\ MGL's contribution through TruNAAT and X-Ray
machines has greatly improved early detection.
The nutrition kits given to patients have also
helped them recover faster by meeting their
basic health needs. We truly appreciate MGL for
this meaningful support in our fight against TB.

Strengthening a lifeline at
Sir J.J. Hospital

In India, around 2 Lakh people suffer
from kidney-related complications every
year and they need to undergo kidney
transplants. But only 5% of them get donors
and undergo transplant, while the rest of
the patients sustain through dialysis, which
sometimes costs around 2 1 Lakh in private
centres every month.

Grant Medical College and Sir Jamshedji
Jeejeebhoy Group of Hospitals, Mumbai
(Sir J.J. Hospital), serves as a lifeline for
thousands of patients across Maharashtra
and beyond. Among its many super-
specialty departments, the Department of
Nephrology stands out for delivering critical
care almost free of cost to those suffering
from severe kidney ailments, mostly from

marginalized groups. With over 3,000-3,500
dialyses performed annually, the AKD unit
operates 24x7, 365 days a year, often under
immense pressure.

In 2022-23, MGL reached out to the Artificial
Kidney department (AKD) of Sir J.J Hospital
to support them with three Haemodialysis
machines along with a dialyser reprocessor
unit for their growing number of kidney
patients. We quickly delivered & installed
three Haemodialysis machines of the
Fresenius make with AMC. Within hours of
installation of these machines, they were
promptly put to the service of patients!

Looking at the utilisation of these dialysis
machines and the growing number
of patients, MGL donated three more
machines of Fresenius make with AMC in
the FY 2024-25.

MGL has been honoured with the Excellence Award for Disease Prevention &
Treatment by The Rotary Foundation, presented by Union Minister Shri Piyush Goyal.
Through the MGL Aarogya initiative, we have reached over 70,000 underserved
individuals across Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, and Raigad, reaffirming our commitment to
community health and well-being.

A few months later, AKD faced a small
crisis of failing dialysis, resulting in patients
being shifted to another state government
hospital. The reason for dialysis failure
was the malfunctioning of the RO plant,
essential for the operation of any dialysis
unit. Recognizing the urgency, MGL swiftly
repaired the existing RO plant as a short-
term fix, but for a long-term solution, MGL
also funded a new RO plant with AMC.

But our support didn’t end there. During a
follow-up visit by our senior management,
it was noticed that four high-quality
Haemodialysis machines (donated during
COVID by a corporate entity} were lying idle
due to the expiry of the AMC. Recognizing
how quickly more lives could be saved at
minimal cost, MGL stepped in once again,
renewing the CMCs and bringing these
machines back into service for the needy
patients.

To further strengthen the dialysis
unit’s capacity and ensure seamless,
uninterrupted treatment, MGL provided
a range of essential consumables like
dialyzer, tubing, AV Fistula needle, Heparin
injections, Catheter, Transducer Protector,
dressing, Chemicals for the re-processor
unit, filtration kit, battery kit, etc. Together,
these consumables, along with ten dialysis
machines, are supporting the doctors and
staff at Sir JJ Hospital’s AKD to provide
world-class dialysis to critical cases & needy
patients, upholding the highest standards of
patient care. It is worthwhile to mention that,
as per the protocol, AKD is now keeping two
machines separately for hepatitis positive
cases.

Through this holistic intervention, we at
MGL sincerely appreciate the relentless
efforts of the doctors and staff at AKD of
Sir JJ Hospital to serve 400 patients every
month, utilising all ten machines supplied/
supported by MGL. With the same number

78

of staff and doctors, AKD is serving more patients every year since MGL joined Sir JJ
Hospital to strengthen the dialysis lifeline for poor patients.

This initiative didn’t just improve infrastructure, it restored dignity and hope to poor patients
who rely on dialysis to survive and motivation for the doctors and support staff to do more. It
reflects MGL’s commitment to going beyond the expected, listening to the unspoken needs
on the ground, and ensuring that healthcare truly reaches those who need it the most.

implemented by Science & Technology Park, Pune and its partner AyuGen Biosciences.

By identifying high-risk cases and ensuring timely treatment, the initiative served as a vital

Extensive Outreach: The programme
successfully initiated over 15 sites for
in North Raigad. The program reached
more than 50,000 women through various
mediums like news coverage (videos,
newspapers, YouTube channels) through
partner organizations and the distribution
of fliers via WhatsApp groups. It also has
resulted in training of over 150 Asha workers
in the Panvel, Pen and Uran area.

Reaching Untouched Areas: The
programme reached to the adivasi areas
such as Bardawadi in Pen, which had not
been previously targeted. Awareness
and screening was conducted in remote
areas such as Kasu village, where many
women work on trains selling local fruits
and snacks.

Early cancer prevention: The programme
collected 2039 samples. For the 1% time
in rural India, the majority of the samples

Awareness and testing on Cervical Cancer conducted for women in the Raigad district

(80%} were self-sampled. This programme
identified about 82 women as HPV positive.
In other words these women were given
an opportunity to prevent cervical cancer.
Among these 39% of the HPV positive
women had the most virulent HPV types
(HPV 16 & 18). All these women were
provided with further evaluations and
management as per the guidelines. To
check persistent infection after providing the
treatment repeat testing for these women
is also covered in this project.

Lives saved: Assuming cost of cancer
treatment at = 6 lakhs (total cost over

Tanaji Kusha Nirguda, 47 years old,

expenses. His worries about his family’s
future escalated with each failed
harvest. Then, through Mahanagar Gas

MGL Hariyali, an unexpected opportunity
presented itself.

Tanaji and 45 other farmers were
introduced to the prospects of beekeeping
at a two-day beekeeping training
programme at the Pen block in Raigad
District. He was sceptical initially, but he
soon recognised that pollination could
boost his crop yield and that producing
honey could be a reliable source of
income. Inspired, he set up his first bee
box close to his struggling crops.

The results were remarkable. His farm
flourished, while honey became a
new source of income. The once-silent
land now buzzed with life—a symbol
of resilience and renewal. The hum of
bees was no longer just a sound. It was
survival. It was renewal. It was hope.

Management Discussion and Analysis

Economic Overview

Global Economic Overview'

The global economy achieved a growth rate of 3.3% in CY 2024,
demonstrating remarkable resilience amidst myriad economic
headwinds. Driven by a gradual decline in inflation, reduced
commodity prices and monetary easing in many countries,
the global economy is making gradual recovery, albeit with
regional disparities.

While the United States exhibited robust growth, major European
countries recorded subdued economic performance, creating a
stark contrast in economic outcomes. For instance, Germany’s
performance has been lagging as compared to other Euro area
countries, owing to the country’s prolonged structural challenges
and fierce global competition, particularly from China. On the
other hand, most developing economies have witnessed an
uptick in economic growth, owing to policy reforms and greater
strength against global shocks.

Global inflation continues to decline, with central banks making
cautious moves in easing monetary policies. Further, global

energy demand is on the rise, despite economic uncertainty,
as major economies are driving the shift towards cleaner
energy sources.

104

Outlook ff

The global growth is projected at 2.8% for CY2025 and 3% for
CY2026. In the United States, underlying demand remains robust
and corporate tax cuts and deregulatory measures can enhance
economic activity in the short term; however, newly imposed
tariffs could lead to inflationary challenges.

Global inflation is expected to average at 4.3% in CY2025,
with the advanced economies reaching their targets faster
than Emerging Markets & Developing Economies (EMDE). It is
anticipated that major economies will focus on recovering from
economic headwinds, increasing energy demand to bolster
industrial activities.

With the U.S., Russia and OPEC nations increasing oil supply,
decline in energy prices is expected. However, due to escalating
geopolitical turmoil, particularly in the Middle East and ongoing
global trade frictions, there is a revised downward projection for
global trade volume in CY2025 and CY2026. Emerging Asia
might witness production decline owing to diminishing exports
to the US. Nevertheless, attempts at bilateral trade deals and
substitution of trade partners portend positively for risk mitigation
within the global economy.

Indian Economic Overview?

Amid a challenging global economic landscape, the Indian
economy continued to exhibit resilience, growing at 6.5% for FY
2024-25. With a steady rural demand, favourable monsoons
and robust performance by the service sector, inflation has
taken a downward trajectory, with headline CPI inflation for the
financial year at 4.6%.

Investment activity gathered momentum during the year, driven
by manufacturing exports, robust output from steel and cement

industries and high capital goods imports. Further, the Indian
government continued to expand infrastructure spending and
facilitate several initiatives, such as the Production Linked
Investment Scheme 2.0, to boost domestic industrial activity.
Additionally, the RBI has reduced interest rates from 6.5% to
6.25%, marking the first cut in five years, further reducing it to 6%
in April, to stimulate economic growth.

Outlook ff

Moving forward, India’s economic prospects remain strong despite
subdued global growth. The Indian economy is projected to be
one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, driven
by increased public infrastructure investment and an upswing
in household investments in real estate as per world bank. On
the supply side, it was supported by uptick in manufacturing
and stable services activity, despite lower Agri output, gradual
decline in inflation and strong consumer spending. Further, the
government's proactive policy measures like Logistics policy &
digital initiative to bring down cost are expected to encourage
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), taking advantage of China
plus 1 opportunity.

To address food shock inflation, the government is implementing
strategic initiatives to mitigate the effects. It is anticipated that
increasing economic activity in tier 3 and tier 4 cities will bolster
domestic demand. Additionally, Stronger monsoon in coming
year coupled with healthy reservoir levels are likely to result in
better performance of agriculture sector. The domestic business
sentiment and consumer confidence are also projected to
maintain their upward momentum. Accommodative monetary
policies, coupled with additional income tax relief for salaried
individuals, is expected to drive growth.

However, India’s international trade is expected to be impacted
by macroeconomic challenges amid the _ tariff-induced
transformation of global trade order. With global supply chain
disruptions, prices of some raw materials might inflate affecting
manufacturers margins. Global downside risk of an economic
slowdown will likely affect investors sentiment in the nation in
the near-term. Conversely, Fll moving away from the US & China
plus one strategy may find the stability of the Indian economy
appealing leading to capital influx in the nation.

India’s energy requirements are also expected to grow at a higher
clip as the nation moves towards a ‘Vikshit Bharat’ by 2047. The
nation has the potential to emerge as a global manufacturing
hotspot, due to notable shift in FDI, accelerated infrastructure
build-out, Production-linked incentives in key sectors, on the
back of the attractive home market.

India’s Mobility Sector

In India, the growing adoption of CNG vehicles marks a significant
shift towards sustainable mobility solutions. In passenger
vehicles segment, the share of CNG variants sales more than
tripled in last five years to 19.5%, overtaking diesel cars sales in
FY25 as per Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).
Increase in CNG stations as well as OEM offering in addition to
price advantage vis a vis Diesel & Petrol are cited as the major
reason for growth in CNG variants sale. This has propelled India
as one of the world’s largest markets for CNG vehicles, with
“77 million CNG-fuelled vehicles on the road.? Further, rapid
infrastructure development, driven by robust public and private
investment, priority allocation of APM-priced gas to this sector
are responsible for the sector’s significant growth.

While Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption is on the rise, the lower initial
cost as well as total cost of ownership of CNG vehicles compared
to EVs & proven track record is mainly driving the CNG Vehicles
growth. There is also a roll out of new CNG vehicle models by
Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). Since 2018, the
number of models/variants of Passenger cars as well as Large
& Heavy commercial vehicles have doubled & during the same
period, the number of variants in Small vehicle have increased by
4 times. It is worth noting that MNC OEM’s like Toyota, Hyundai,
Citroén who do not have any CNG variants world over have for
the 1% time introduced CNG variants only for Indian market. This
clearly demonstrates the attractiveness of Indian market for
CNG, both from supply & demand side.

The freight and logistics industry is also turning towards CNG,
driven by favourable economics. The rise in E-way bills for Inter-
State transactions by 17% YoY in FY 2025 suggests stronger
economic activity, as businesses increase movement of goods
across the country. CNG refuelling stations, alongside LNG
solutions tailored for long-haul freight, are strongly positioned to
reap the rewards of the shift towards cleaner mobility solutions.

The heavy commercial vehicles usage is about
30 kgs per day on an average. LCV is about 20 kgs
and the small commercial vehicles consume
about 7.5 kgs daily.

Company Overview

Established in 1995, Mahanagar Gas Limited (MGL} is one of
India’s leading CGD companies. MGL has played a pivotal role
in expanding natural gas infrastructure and promoting its usage
across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and adjoining areas. The
Company serves diverse customer segments, including domestic

households, commercial establishments, industrial users and
the automotive sector, through its piped natural gas (PNG) and
compressed natural gas (CNG) offerings.

The Company upholds a strong commitment towards safety,
operational excellence and environmental sustainability.
Operating an extensive distribution network that ensures reliable
access to eco-friendly fuel solutions, MGL has been instrumental
in supporting India’s transition to a gas-based economy.

The Company was entrusted by the Petroleum and Natural Gas
Regulatory Board (PNGRB} to expand its operations to Raigad
district in 2015, achieving a significant milestone in contributing
to cleaner energy adoption while maintaining sustainable
urban development. For Financial year 2024-25, Sales volume
increased by 12.27% y-o-y while total sales volume for the FY
2024-25 stood at 4.052 MMSCMD.

Gas Sourcing

MGL gas sourcing primarily involves sourcing of natural gas in line
with the consumption of gas across different sectors like Domestic
PNG, PNG (Industrial & Commercial) and CNG (transport).

MGL has prudent cost-effective sourcing strategy that involves
procuring natural gas from various sources, including domestic and
RLNG supplies based at different benchmark price indices. This
strategy helps us maintain competitive pricing and profitability.

Various sources from which MGL sources gas_ include
domestically produced gas i.e., APM/ Non-APM gas, New Well
Gas, HPHT gas and Term RLNG, Market Determined Price (MDP)
gas and Spot RLNG.

Domestically Produced Gas
APM/ Non-APM Gas:

MGL sources a significant portion of its natural gas
requirement through domestic allocation by the GOI under
the Administered Pricing Mechanism (APM). The domestic
gas being the cheapest comes with an advantage of price
stability as compared to all other available sources. As per
MoP&NG guidelines, APM / Non-APM gas is supplied for only
to the priority segments, namely, CNG (transport} and D-PNG.
The allocation of domestic gas to MGL/ any other CGD entity
is based on the consumption of natural gas in D-PNG and CNG
segments. APM gas prices are currently linked to the 10% of
the monthly average of Indian Crude Basket and the price
varies with change in crude oil prices. In FY 2024-25, APM
ceiling price was at US$6.50/MMBTU. However, currently
APM gas price is set at ceiling price of US$6.75/MMBTU.

10

New Well Gas

New Well Gas (NWG) from nomination fields of ONGC and OIL
is allocated to MGL based on the consumption of natural gas
in D-PNG and CNG segments, in accordance with prevailing
MoP&NG guidelines. New Well Gas price priced at 12% of monthly
average Indian Crude Basket price.

HPHT Gas:

While APM / Non-APM / NWG gas is allocated by MoP&NG in
favour of CGD entities, such allocation is insufficient to cater to
the demand of the priority segments. Under such circumstances,
High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) gas would need to
be organized for commingling with domestic gas to cater to
the demand of CNG and D-PNG segments. HPHT gas contract
price is linked to Brent and JKM prices subject to ceiling price
determined as per MoP&NG guidelines. Ceiling price is calculated
using the landed cost of alternate fuels like fuel oil, weighted
average import landed price of substitute fuels and LNG import
landed price. In FY 2024-25, HPHT average ceiling price was at
US$10.02/MMBTU. However, at present ceiling price for HPHT
gas stands at US$10.04/MMBTU.

Term RLNG- Market Determined Price (MDP) Gas

The Term RLNG contracts are gas supply contracts with 3-5 years
period linked to brent /JKM/ Henry-Hub indices and are crucial for
ensuring supply security and stability. In order to obtain a balance
mix in the portfolio and for better price stability as well as security of
supplies, MGL has executed term agreements with various suppliers
where the price of gas is linked with different benchmarks to meet the
requirement of other than priority sectors like industrial or commercial
PNG and also for any shortfall in D-PNG and CNG segments.

Spot RLNG

To cater to peak requirement and fluctuation in demand, MGL
sources Spot RLNG through Spot market purchases, or through
Gas Exchange platform such as IGX. At present, MGL has entered
into Framework Agreements / Term Sheets for Spot RLNG
supplies with various suppliers across India.

To optimise our supply chain, we adopt a well-balanced gas
sourcing strategy, blending Domestic, MDP gas with both Spot
and Term RLNG contracts. This approach enhances price stability
and ensures a reliable supply. We have established strong
partnerships with major suppliers, including GAIL, IOCL, BPCL
and others, formalised through Framework Agreements and
Term Sheets, securing our supply chain for the future.

We also engage with industry associations such as Federation
of Indian Petroleum Industry (FIPI) and Natural Gas Society

(NGS), subscription services like Bloomberg etc which offer
valuable insights into market trends, regulatory developments
and emerging technologies. These resources are important in
enhancing resilience of our supply chain.

To further ensure cost competitiveness & reliability of spot
supplies, we issue monthly tenders for Spot RLNG, either on
a Reasonable Endeavour or Firm basis, allowing for greater
flexibility. Our close collaboration with our suppliers & use of
data analytics allows us to accurately forecast demand, plan
for seasonal variations and uninterrupted supply. To streamline
operations further, we execute Gas Sales and Purchase Notices
(GSPN) with selected suppliers, ensuring seamless transactions
under the Framework Agreements and Term Sheets.

LNG Sourcing for Automotive Sector

MGL is sourcing LNG through long term contract for supply to
automotive sector at a competitive price for its LNG station at
Savroli. Further Mahanagar LNG Private Limited (MLPL), a JV
between MGL and Baidyanath LNG Private Limited is sourcing
LNG through long term contract for supply to automotive sector
at a competitive price for its first LNG station at Sambhaji Nagar.
This long-term contract will also be suitably amended to further
facilitate LNG supply for MLPL’s upcoming LNG stations ensuring
uninterrupted and steady operations.

Segment-wise Overview
Automotive Segment (CNG)

The Company had 385 CNG stations at the end of FY 2025. In
the Raigad area, it has established 65 CNG stations till end of FY
2025.MGL caters to around “10% of commercial vehicles which
are on CNG in its area of operation. In FY 25, the Company
achieved the historically high CNG volume growth of “11%. This
growth was driven by increased adoption of CNG vehicles due
to auto manufacturers expanding their CNG vehicle lineup, with
the number of CNG models in passenger vehicles doubling from
11 (2018) to 25 in FY 2025, increase in CNG stations thereby
ensuring ease of fuelling & Sales promotion undertaken
by your company.

During the year under review, the Company launched “CNG

Mumbai Metropolitan Region’s Bakery Industry:
Potential for PNG adoption

The bakery industry inthe MMRis a vital part of the city's food
ecosystem, encompassing approximately 628 registered
bakeries and potentially many more unregistered entities.
These bakeries are small-scale enterprises with majority
operating single unit. The sector uses diverse types of
fuels ranging from traditional wood-fired operations to
modern establishments using electricity or gas.

Fuel usage patterns indicate significant reliance on wood,
with 47% of surveyed bakeries using it as their primary
fuel. This has considerable environmental consequences,
contributing “3,200 kg/day of particulate matter (PM),
which accounts for 3.5% of Mumbai's total PM emissions.

In January 2024, the Bombay High Court ordered all
bakeries in MMR to transition from wood-fired ovens to

N12

were also targeted for affordable PNG solutions. Monthly
PNG registrations surged from 2,000 to 8,000 during the year,
indicating a 3X-4X increase.

MGL partnered with builders in Badlapur, Amarnath and Taloja
to install PNG connections in unsold flats to boost adoption.
PNG adoption in Raigad has increased, with pipelines being Laid
in Mahad, Vile Bhagad, Roha and JNPT. Restaurants, bakeries,
hotels and hospitals have been a key focus area for the Company
due to their high PNG consumption.

cleaner fuels like PNG or electricity mitigate air pollution
caused by wood-burning bakeries.

The industry has responded with concerns including
inadequate pipeline access, technical difficulties and financial
constraints leading to slow adoption of PNG in this sector.

To address these challenges, MGL has implemented
supportive measures including waiving security deposits for
PNG connections and offering to bear infrastructure costs.

The successful implementation of this transition would not
only reduce Mumbai's air pollution but could also serve
as a model for similar initiatives in other sectors and cities,
potentially accelerating the broader adoption of natural gas
as a cleaner fuel throughout India’s urban centres.

Industrial and Commercial Segment

MGLs Industrial and Commercial {(l&C) segment demonstrated
robust performance during FY 2024-25. The Company witnessed
a significant increase in I&C volumes, growing from 0.50 MMSCMD
in the previous year to 0.62 MMSCMD, representing an increase of
24%. This growth can be primarily attributed to the addition of 450
new industrial and commercial customers in FY 2025, increasing the
1&C customer base to “5,100 (as of March 31, 2025). Addition of new
customers has bolstered MGL's market presence and contributed to
the Company’s commitment to promoting cleaner fuel alternatives
across various industries & commercial establishment.

Automotive Segment (LNG)

LNG is suitable for long-haul trucking due to higher energy
density compared to CNG, enabling longer range. As diesel is
the mainstay of trucking in India, LNG not only offers lower fuel
costs but also lower emissions. MGL is steadily strengthening its
presence in the LNG sector through its joint venture, MLPL. As
a result, the first LNG station of MLPL has been commissioned
in Aurangabad, Maharashtra in October 2024, touching daily
sales of 4.5 tons. The second station at Seoni, MP of MLPL was
mechanically completed in the current FY & commercial sales is
expected to start soon.

The Company is planning to commission few more stations
in the FY2025-26, which will be strategically located on the
industrial belts and major transportation corridors, to ensure
easy accessibility thereby maximising adoption. The planned
locations are Bhiwandi, Amravati, JNPT, ete. Concurrently, MLPL
is also collaborating with major OEMs to promote LNG-powered
commercial vehicles while deeply engaging the Fleet owners.

Meanwhile, LNG sales at the Company's Savroli station have shown
steady growth, reaching a peak sales volume of 4.6 tonnes per day.
These consistent efforts position MGL as a significant contributor
in transition to cleaner fuels, reducing diesel dependency and
supporting India’s sustainability goals. It is also worth mentioning
that MGL is the first user of made in India LNG trucks.

LNG as virtual pipeline solution for supply of PNG/CNG in
non gassified areas

LNG stations/units can be set up in non-gasified areas of MGL
authorised areas to supply PNG/CNG. Several MIDC areas/
Industrial and Commercial establishments where NG pipeline has
not reached, the gas supply issue can be addressed with the LNG
expertise of MGL & its partners. This will lead to a breakthrough
in volume growth for MGL & its associate companies. The
Company had initiated dialogue with one of major Industries to
supply Natural gas with LNG facility in Mahad MIDC. This can be
replicated to many non-gassified areas & MGL is identifying &
preparing long-term plans to address such potential areas.

GAS

During the year, MGL engaged in several rounds of discussions
with CIDCO officials and submitted a draft Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) outlining the proposed development of
PNG infrastructure in these mass housing complexes.

The MoU, which is presently under review by CIDCO,
covers nearly 68,000 households — both existing and
under construction — across key nodes such as Taloja, New
Panvel, Vashi, Kalamboli, Navade, Bamandongri, Mansarovar
and other regions.

Out of the total, approximately 25,000 tenements are ready
for occupancy. MGL plans to prioritize the rollout of PNG
infrastructure in these areas, enabling early access to a clean and
efficient energy source. This initiative reinforces our commitment to.
accelerating city gas distribution and supporting sustainable urban
development in partnership with key urban planning authorities.

The Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority
(MHADA), established under the Maharashtra Housing
and Area Development Act of 1976, plays a pivotal role
in providing affordable housing solutions across the state
with special focus on Mumbai. It coordinates and oversees
the functioning of seven regional housing boards-Mumbai,
Konkan, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Amravati and Aurangabad-
as well as two special-purpose boards: the Mumbai Building
Repairs and Reconstruction Board and the Mumbai Slum
Improvement Board.

Each year, MHADA constructs approximately 3,000 to 5,000
flats in the Mumbai region, with numbers varying based on
budget allocations and project plans. In line with efforts
to enhance the quality of life for residents, MGL is in active
discussions with MHADA to provide PNG (Piped Natural Gas)
infrastructure in new housing projects, ensuring that occupants
can avail the benefits from the date of possession.

These developments indicate a strong focus on addressing
housing needs across various segments in MMR. As a result,
it is anticipated that there will be an uptick in demand for PNG
connections in the region.

To address demand emanating from such Low-income
group housing, MGL has launched many customised
schemes for PNG connections

Automotive Segment (EV)

The traction witnessed in the adoption of electric vehicles in
last mile delivery and passenger segments and considering the
Government's push for EV, it is imperative that MGL, being an
energy distribution company and a flagbearer of greener fuel,
encourages and nurtures such transition.

MGL has established a joint venture with International Battery
Company Inc, a company based out of US, to setup prismatic
NMC chemistry Li-ion cell manufacturing facility at Bengaluru.
The project is being implemented in two phases, with the first
phase expected to be operational by the first quarter of 2026 and
the second by the first quarter of 2027. The facility aims to scale
up production to 5 GWh by 2030 and explore new technologies
such as solid-state, sodium-ion and LFP/LFMP batteries.

Additionally, MGL has acquired “31% stake in 3EV Industries
Pvt. Ltd., an electric 3-wheeler cargo and passenger vehicle
manufacturing company based out of Bengaluru. This positions
MGL as one of the key players in supporting the transition of the
mobility sector to greener alternatives. Further, the shift from
traditional fossil fuel like MS/HSD to EV will happen first, whereas
CNG segment is expected to continue growing.

Key Business Highlights

The Company has made notable progress in expanding its
operations and diversifying its portfolio during the period under
review. It acquired three additional land parcels for setting up
City Gate Station (CGS) facilities in the GA-3 area. Two CGS’s are
likely to be commissioned in FY2025-26 which will result in not
only saving substantial cost of CTV transport but will also reduce
the dependence on the lone CGS of GA-3 at Savroli & ensure
elimination of Dry outs in the DBS stations of GA-3.

In South Mumbai, MGL’s presence either through its own exclusive
outlets or OMC outlets was not adequate to serve CNG customers.
With continuous efforts, your company managed to secure two
large plots on long-term leases from Mumbai Port Authority on
the crucial P D’mello Road which is not only crucial link to south
mumbai but also serves as main road for commercial vehicles traffic
to Mumbai Port as well as connects the Mumbai Trans harbour link
to Mumbai. Commissioning of these two large format CNG stations
will address the gap of CNG availability in South Mumbai.

In the competitive transport fuel market, your company continues
to maintain a competitive edge by offering CNG at “50% discount
compared to petrol and “16-18% discount to HSD.

The year under review also witnessed a significant milestone of
crossing 100 exclusive MGL-branded CNG stations, increasing its
footprint and customer reach. Now your company has 111 exclusive
MGL-branded CNG stations as on March 31, 2025, enhancing
brand visibility. It also co located CNG in Jio BP’s 5 outlets in this
FY adding one more partner amongst Oil Marketing companies.

Further improving operational efficiency, MGL implemented
‘Empower application for dealer management across all
Company-Owned Company-Operated (COCO) and Dealer-Owned
Dealer-Operated (DODO) stations. The Company added three
mother station facilities at private CNG retail outlets to ensure
uninterrupted CNG supplies to its +100 Daughter Booster Stations.

In the CNG segment, your company added 40 new CNG filling
stations with offtake during the year reaching 2.8 MMSCMD.

Building on the success of the 1** CNG Mahotsav, MGL launched
CNG Mahotsav 2.0, a more refined initiative aimed at promoting
the adoption of CNG as a cleaner and economical fuel.

This year, the CNG Mahotsav 2.0 laid focus on the commercial
vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) of 3.5 tonnes
dnd above. The initiative commenced in September 2024 for
retrofitted vehicles and in October 2024 for new CNG vehicles.
OEMs viz. Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors Ltd. and VE Commercial
Vehicles Ltd. wholeheartedly participated in the CNG Mahotsav.
Additionally strategic collaborations were established with

The CNG Mahotsav 2.0 offered compelling incentives for
transporters to opt for CNG vehicles. Incentive upto %3,50,000
worth of free CNG was offered for the purchase of a new CNG
vehicle and an equivalent discount for retrofitting a diesel vehicle
to CNG. During the scheme period, OEM’s witnessed a 100%
increase in the monthly average CNG vehicle sales.

This initiative is a key step in strengthening the transport
sector’s confidence in CNG as a viable, environmentally friendly
alternative, encouraging the expansion of cleaner and greener
commercial fleets.

To motivate the CNG dealers while ensuring compliances
of various safety & commercial guidelines, your company
organised dealers meet covering new and established CNG
dealers and COCO operators. The top performing dealers were
awarded in various categories & interactions of the dealers with
management of your company was very fruitful & motivating
for the dealer network. For enrolling new CNG dealers, MGL
streamlined & introduced a simplified and customer-friendly
application process for new CNG dealerships, available in both
English and Marathi.

During the year, the Company expanded its total PNG connectivity
to “2.83 million. Parallelly, PNG offtake stood at 117 MMSCMD,
registering a growth of “15% YOY. These initiatives collectively

underscore MGL’s commitment to growth, operational excellence
and customer satisfaction, while simultaneously expanding its
footprint in the clean energy sector.

Unison Enviro Private Limited (UEPL), a CGD entity was taken
over by your company in Feb 2024 & it’s now a wholly owned
subsidiary. It’s worthwhile to mention that in its 5 years of
existence prior to MGL’s takeover, UEPL had Constructed only 53
CNG stations but Post takeover, UEPL has added 29 CNG stations
till FY 25, taking its station count from 53 to 82. The Company
has also added 12,000+ new PNG connections during the year.

The increase in CNG stations, Pipeline Length as well as PNG
connection has resulted in “40% increase in sale volume to
1,82,000 SCMD in FY25. During the year, UEPL has achieved
highest industrial sales touching 20,000 SCMD.

Under its joint venture with International Battery Company, Inc.,
the Company plans to develop solid-state, sodium-ion and LFP/
LFMP battery chemistries, ensuring that it remains at the forefront
of battery innovation. MGL has committed to invest % 385 Cr. in the

SWOT Analysis

Strengths

1.

Dominant Market Position

MGL has established a strong foothold in India’s most
economically vibrant region, the commercial capital of
the country & its satellites like Thane & Navi Mumbai. The
Company’s operations span across Mumbai, Urban Thane
and Raigad, covering an impressive 8,372 sq. km. Following
the strategic acquisition of UEPL, MGL has broadened its
operational remit to include Ratnagiri, Latur - Osmanabad in
Maharashtra and Chitradurga & Davanagere in Karnataka,
thereby significantly adding geographical area under
operation by © 37,400 sq. km.

MGLss extensive network ensures widespread accessibility
and reliability of gas supply across its operational areas.
The acquisition of UEPL has further bolstered MGLs
infrastructure as the Ratangiri GA is contiguous to MGL's
Raigad GA which will result in substantial saving going
forward, enhancing last-mile connectivity in semi-urban and
rural geographical areas (GAs).

Interms of marketshare, MGL strives to enhance volume growth
aggressively in the CNG segment. Further, the Company’s
sales volumes represents significant YOY growth, highlighting
MGLs project execution process, operational efficiency, tailor
made marketing campaign and digital interventions which not
only increased the overall natural gas requirement but helped
in effective management of such demand.

2. Strong Financial Metrics and Profitability

MGLs financial performance in FY2024-25 has been
exceptional, demonstrating the Company’s _ financial
prudence and adeptness in generating substantial profits.
Net profit stood at % 1,045 Cr. & EBITDA of = 1,510 Cr. These
figures indicate MGL's efficient natural gas sourcing strategy,
operational efficiency, strategic decision-making and ability
to control costs, even while expanding its operational reach.

MGLs liquidity position remains strong, with a current ratio of
1.03 {current assets: = 1891 Cr. vs. current liabilities: = 1840 Cr).
This ensures that the Company can comfortably meet its
short-term obligations, while maintaining sufficient resources
for both ongoing operations and future investments.

3. Strategic Diversification Initiatives

The key to success lies in keeping an eye on the future.
MGL has structured its business model to capture the
emerging opportunities in the energy sector. The Company

Corporate Statutory Financial
Overview Reports —_Statements
* * *

has entered into a joint venture with Baidyanath LNG
Private Limited to build LNG stations for long-haul trucks.
Apart from promoting cleaner freight transportation, this
strategic move positions MGL to capitalise on the rapidly
growing LNG trucking in India.

Further, MGL has acquired a stake in 3EV Industries, a three-
wheeler EV original equipment manufacturer (OEM). This
investment allows MGL to participate in the last-mile logistics
segment, particularly in e-commerce delivery vehicles,
which are increasingly adopting electric powertrains.

The EV adoption across the mobility sector is increasing
rapidly, with 2-wheeler leading the pack. While battery
packs are manufactured in India, battery cells being a
major component, are currently being imported, leaving
a white space for local manufacturing of such cell. MGL
joining hands with International Battery Company for
manufacturing of lithium-ion cells in India would be a big
leap forward in serving the energy requirement of the
e-mobility segment.

4. Safety and Operational Excellence

MGL drives exceptional operational performance and
upholds a strong commitment to safety. The Company
serves an impressive customer base of “2.83 million
domestic PNG connections and ~5,00 industrial and
commercial customers, ensuring a stable revenue stream
and opportunities for future growth.

Notably, MGL has maintained an impeccable safety
record, with Zero Loss Time Injury (LTI) for FY 2024-25.
This achievement reflects the Company’s commitment to
maintaining the highest safety standards in its operations,
which is crucial in the gas distribution industry.

Weaknesses

1. High Capital Intensity and Infrastructure Development
Challenges

While MGL's extensive infrastructure underscores the company's
scale and commitment to long-term development, it also
requires considerable capital investment, sans the complexity
attached to execution of project in one of the most urban and
densely populated region where long monsoon requires
infrastructure rollout within limited time-period. The company
invested = 1,023 Cr. in FY2024-25 for pipeline expansion and
station development; further, it plans to add 200 CNG stations
and 180+ kms of pipelines by 2029, requiring more capital.

17

MAHANAGAR
GAS

18

Mahanagar Gas Limited
Annual Report 2024-25

Additionally, the Company has faced delays in pipeline
rollout, particularly in the Raigad area, due to delayed
laying permissions. These delays impact expansion plans
and increase operational costs.

MGL is continuously advocating with the concerned civic body
for timely release of required approvals including facility of a
single window clearance for seamless project execution.

Dependence on Domestic Gas Allocation

While MGL benefits from APM gas allocation, this also
represents a potential vulnerability. The Company relied on
domestic gas to meet approximately 65% of its demand, while
the remaining 35% is sourced from imports in the FY 2024-
25. This approach exposes MGL to volatile international
LNG prices, with the fluctuations ranging between $ 12 and
$ 14/MMBTU in the review year. Profitability can be gravely
impacted on account of any significant reduction in domestic
gas allocation or sharp increase in international LNG prices.

MGL continuously scans and monitors the LNG price
trends across indices and based on current long term
price visibility, adopts a portfolio strategy of spot and term
contracts for optimized sourcing of natural gas.

Land Avatliability

Mumbai, the commercial capital of India, faces significant
challenges in expanding infrastructure to accommodate
growing energy needs, particularly in the setting up of
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) stations. This challenge
stems from a combination of factors, including land
scarcity, exorbitant prices, land use reservations,
encroachments, applicability of CRZ, NDZ/SEZ norms
etc. Land use in Mumbai is governed by the Development
Control and Promotion Regulation (DCPR) under the
Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). These
regulations restrict the types of developments including
setting up of CNG fueling stations in different zones.

MGL is consistently working with Govt. of Maharashtra
(GoM), BMC, Mumbai Port Authority (MbPA), State Transport
Undertakings (STUs) and other Govt. agencies like MMRDA,
CIDCO, MIDC, MSRDC, etc., to address such challenges
and facilitate land availability for setting up CNG stations to
meet the natural gas requirement of the citizens.

Geographic Concentration Risks

Despite recent expansions, MGLs revenue remains
heavily concentrated in the Mumbai and Thane regions.
Approximately 90% of the company's natural gas volume
is derived from these areas, while new geographical areas
such as Raigad and those acquired through UEPL contribute

wily

to a mere 10% to the overall gas volume. This concentration
exposes MGL to regional economic fluctuations and
potential regulatory changes specific to these areas.

A significant chunk of the total capex is deployed to
lay infrastructure in Raigad district and UEPL GAs. GA3
comprising of Raigad district is poised for significant
economic growth with the upcoming of a new International
Airport at Navi Mumbai. Additionally, the district has been
identified for development of Mumbai 3, a plan which will
transform this region into an urban area, requiring sizable
volume of natural gas to meet its energy requirement,
thereby steadily bringing down the disparity in sales
in the three geographical areas and earmarking of this
area for Mumbai 3.

Limited Project Execution Window

The extended monsoon in Mumbai region reduces the
project execution window (October to April), limiting
infrastructure development work to approximately 7
months in a year.

MGL proactively follows up with civic body for timely
release of approvals for faster rollout of infrastructure
within the limited available time-period. Additionally
MGL has also been trying to work around the constraints
by using advocacy as a tool to mitigate operations
constraints. A case in points is recent success in getting
advance permissions from BMC & Traffic Police. Earlier,
the Permission window used to open on 1* October every
year & the actual work used to start only by end October
/November beginning after receipt of Demand note,
its payment & followed by Traffic police permissions.
Through continuous interactions & advocacy, MGL
managed to convenience BMC as well as Traffic Police to
agree to issue the work permission in advance enabling
MGL to start the work from 1* October itself.

CGD Expansion

Between 2025 and 2032, the country is projected to add
™5 million new residential gas connections annually,
resulting in a total of “126 million household connections
by 2032. The number of CNG filling stations is anticipated
to increase by “1,400 every year during the same period.
This expansion will lead to over “18,000 CNG stations

operational across India by 2032, further supporting the
country’s transition to cleaner fuel alternatives.

The acquisition of UEPL has presented new geographical
areas measuring “37,400 Sq Km for MGL with significant
growth potential in Maharashtra & Karnataka covering
Ratnagiri, Latur Osmanabad & Chitradurga/Davanagere.
MGL can leverage its brand equity and operational
expertise to increase market penetration, targeting
industrial customers in these regions.

Policy Tailwinds and Infrastructure Investments

The Indian government targets to increase the share of
natural gas in the country’s energy mix to 15% by 2030
(from 6%) which is expected to drive significant investments
in LNG infrastructure. The International Energy Agency (IEA)
projects $67 billion in LNG infrastructure investments in India
by 2030. This presents opportunities for MGL to partner
with national entities and international players for projects,
further strengthening its position in the gas value chain.

The increase of Natural Gas in energy mix has to happen
through the CGD route through greater adoption of natural
gas by the Industrial, Commercial, Mobility and household
sector. Enabling policies such as mandatory use of D-PNG
by customers in gasified buildings, mandatory D-PNG
connect in new buildings, discouraging use of diesel
vehicles in cities, reduction in excise duty on CNG, reduction
of tax on CNG vehicles, development and implementation
of state CGD policy can help achieve the government's
targeted share of NG by 2030.

Additionally, increased Government Capex in infrastructure
development including roads and highways is expected
to translate into elevated commercial freight movement.
With operationalisation of Navi Mumbai airport and
development of Mumbai 3 due to Mumbai Trans harbour
Link operationalisation & Navi Mumbai International airport,
the economic activity at Navi Mumbai and Raigad area is
expected to grow manifold, leading to rapid infrastructure
development and urbanization in the coming years.

Recent court rulings and policy mandates are also expected
to drive CNG and PNG adoption. A recent Bombay High
Court ruling not only mandates commercial establishments
(Bakeries} in Mumbai to switch to PNG but also formed a
committee to phase out Diesel Fueled vehicles from MMR
which may push CNG & PNG growth for MGL."*

LNG for Long-Haul Mobility

The Indian government is aiming to convert a third of the
nation’s long-haul heavy-duty vehicles to LNG in the next
five to seven years, creating a substantial new market
for natural gas consumption. MGL’s joint venture with
Baidyanath LNG, MLPL positions the Company to capture
an estimated 15-20% market share in key corridors such
as Mumbai-Pune, Mumbai-Nashik & Mumbai Nagpur in the
newly opened Samruddhi Mahamarg. By leveraging its
existing infrastructure and expertise in gas distribution, MGL
can establish a strong presence in this growing segment.

Expansion of Industrial and Commercial PNG Segment

With the government's push for cleaner industrial fuels, MGL
has the opportunity to expand its industrial and commercial
PNG customer base. The Company can target small and
medium enterprises in its operational areas, offering a cleaner
and potentially more cost-effective alternative to traditional
fuels. This expansion can be supported by tailored marketing
campaigns, flexible pricing strategies and value-added services
to attract and retain industrial customers. The commercial
sector also presents a significant opportunity for natural gas
adoption. LPG enjoys more popularity as compared to piped
natural gas, however, it is anticipated that natural gas could
fully replace commercial LPG usage by 2030.

Bio-CNG from Municipal Waste

MGL has entered into a MoU with the Brihanmumbai
Municipal Corporation (BMC) to process 1,000 tonnes per
day of municipal waste into Bio-CNG. This initiative not only
contributes in reducing landfill emissions but also has the
potential to secure 5-8% of MGL's gas supply locally. By
expanding this project, MGL can promote environmental
stewardship, reduce dependence on imported LNG and
meet the GOIl’s compulsory blending obligations.

Digital Transformation and Operational Efficiency

MGL embraces advanced digital technologies to enhance
operational efficiency and customer experience. The
Company's MGL Connect 2.0 app, which has over 500,000
downloads, can be further developed to include features
such as real-time CNG queue tracking and online PNG
registration. Reduction in queue time through expansion of
CNG stations and technological integration would increase
convenience for the customers and promote conversion to
CNG. By investing in smart metering, Al-powered demand
forecasting and blockchain for supply chain management,
the Company can optimise its operations, reduce costs and
improve customer satisfaction.

Threats

1.

APM Gas Allocation

In the coming years, production from legacy gas fields is
projected to further reduce the availability of Administered
Pricing Mechanism (APM} gas—which is priced by the
government and predominantly allocated to the CNG and
Domestic PNG (D-PNG) segments.

APM gas may meet an increasingly smaller proportion of total
demand of priority segment, leading to higher blending of
costly market price gas like New well gas, High Pressure High
Temperature (HPHT} gas & RLNG. To bridge the gap, MGL may
need to rely more heavily on costlier alternative gas sources,
such as: New Well Gas allocation, Gas from HPHT fields and
Long-term contracts linked to global price benchmarks. These
higher-cost sources could adversely impact profit margins and
challenge efforts to maintain price stability for end consumers.

In response, MGL is proactively diversifying its gas sourcing
portfolio to reduce reliance on APM allocations. As part of
its strategic approach, the company is securing Long-term
gas supply contracts with multiple suppliers. This initiative
is aimed at strengthening supply security and ensuring a
consistent and reliable supply of natural gas to customers,
while maintaining price stability.

LNG Price Volatility

In addition to APM gas supplies, your company has to rely
on imported LNG to meet part of CNG demand as well as for
almost entire demand of Industrial & commercial segment.
The spot LNG market is subject to significant price fluctuations,
impacting profitability, especially if the Company is unable to
pass on price increases to end-consumers.

To effectively meet such volatility of LNG price in spot
market, your company takes a portfolio approach to source
its LNG demand through Term & spot contracts thereby
optimising overall cost of imported LNG.

Regulatory Volatility

The potential expiry of both marketing and infrastructure
exclusivity of Mumbai and Greater Mumbai poses risks
for the Company in terms of MGL offering 20% of its
pipeline capacity on a common carrier basis in case of
expiry of marketing exclusivity and allowing other entities

to lay and operate natural gas distribution networks in
the same geography in case of expiry of infrastructure
exclusivity. The expiry of exclusivity rights introduces the
risk of increased competition, which could impact MGLs
competitiveness and margins.

However, as a company we have challenged both
the marketing and infrastructure exclusivity on core
legal principles which the regulator has missed out
while notifying the Authorisation Regulations and other
connected regulations like Transportation Tariff and the
Guiding Principles Regulations. We have also given our
representation before the PNGRB wherein we have given
our views on how the exclusivity can be opened while
protecting the interest of the Company. Our matter is
currently pending disposal before the Delhi High Court,
wherein the court is seized of the matter.

In the event of loss of marketing exclusivity (which will also be
applicable to other CGDs), MGL will still get the transmission
tariff on the 20% of the pipeline capacity which may be used
by other CGD entities. On the other hand, MGL will also have
the opportunity to venture out in other CGD’s GA for its growth.

EV Disruption in CNG Segment

The rapid advancement of EV technology poses a
significant threat to MGL’s core CNG business. The total
cost of ownership (TCO} for EVs on the back of Government
subsidies is likely to pose significant challenge for
Passenger cars as well as 2/3 wheelers going forward
especially due to falling battery costs.

In the three-wheeler segment, which is a key market for
CNG, MGL is likely to experience tough competition due to
the adoption of e-rickshaws. As EV technology improves and
charging infrastructure expands along with falling battery
cost, this trend could accelerate potentially impacting CNG
market share. However, the Companys diversified strategy,
with investment in the EV battery segment, allows it to
ameliorate the threat of EV competition.

Infrastructure Bottlenecks

The growth of India’s natural gas sector, including MGL’s
expansion plans, could be constrained by infrastructure
bottlenecks. The country’s current LNG regasification
capacity stands at 52.7 MMTPA, however, demand for
natural gas is expected to rise by 60% by 2030. To meet
the projected demand, the nation is investing in LNG
infrastructure with a number of projects under construction
or in planning stages.”

Mergers and Acquisitions

Strategic partnerships play as a crucial role in building strong
organisations. The Company aims to build strong alliances to tap
the future growth opportunities as well as to hedge the decline.

The Company’s joint venture with International Battery Company,
Inc. will help establish MGL as a multi-faceted energy provider in
the years to come. The joint venture aims to capture the demand
generated by the increasing adoption of EVs by exploring new
technologies in energy storage solutions.

The Company's joint venture with Baidyanath LNG provides
increased security within its supply chain, whereas the acquisition of
Unison Enviro Private Limited, a CGD with three geographical areas,
extends operational reach and improves natural gas accessibility
for consumers. At the end of FY 2025, Unison Enviro Private Limited
had 82 CNG stations while cumulative household connections were
39,000 and industrial and commercial customers were 66.

MGL is steadily exploring new opportunities and leveraging
synergies to ensure long-term business sustainability.

New Business

Compressed Biogas (CBG)

MGL has made significant progress in its Compressed Biogas
{CBG) initiatives, actively pursuing opportunities within its
authorised Geographical Areas (GA's) while also exploring
expansion in new regions too. As part of this strategy, MGL has
entered into a MOU with Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation
{BMC) to set up one of the largest CBG Plants in India based on
municipal Solid Waste MSW) in Deonar Mumbai with a Source
Segregated Organic MSW processing capacity of 1000 Tonnes
Per Day (TPD). Maharashtra State Cabinet has accorded the
approval for leasing of land at concessional rate to MGL in May
2025 through a cabinet decision for setting up the CBG project
at Mankhurd and Deonar Landfill area using the Bio-methanation
technology. As per GR (Government Resolution) issued on
May 28, 2025, total 18 acres of land will be leased to MGL.

Further, Company intends to increase its CBG footprints and
replicate the model in other Municipalities offering a significant
potential in the CBG sector. MGL has signed a MOU with City
Corporation of Davanagere to establish 150TPD CBG plant again
based on MSW. Additionally, MGL is also exploring collaborations
with other players and stakeholders to set up the CBG Plants
on alternative feedstocks viz. Napier Grass, Press Mud, Cow
Dung etc. These initiatives are in line with India’s broader goals
of lowering the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, promoting a

circular economy, reducing fuel imports and improving the waste
management practices.

Through these efforts, MGL is poised to establish itself as a key
player in India’s renewable energy landscape contributing to
environmental sustainability and domestic biofuel production.

Renewable Energy

India’s renewable energy sector is poised for significant
growth, driven by ambitious government policies, increasing
investments,and a strong push for energy transition. The country
has set a target of achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by
2030 with a focus on solar, wind, hydropower and green hydrogen.
As of March 2025, India’s total installed electricity generation
capacity is approximately 475.21 GW. Renewable energy sources,
including solar, wind, hydro and biomass, contribute about 22010
GW to this capacity, representing approximately 46.3% of the total.
To meet its ambitious target of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by
2030, India needs to double its annual additions of solar and wind
capacity over the next five years.

MGL is taking a proactive approach towards renewable energy
to support India’s clean energy goals. Your company is actively
expanding its footprint in renewable energy, starting with a 6.5
MW plant to meet the power requirement at COCO (Company-
Owned, Company-Operated) CNG stations. Going forward,
MGL is in the process of developing its entry strategy in the
renewable energy value chain.

Hydrogen

As part of company’s diversification strategy, new and emerging
energy sector is always prioritized above others.

Though green hydrogen is in its nascent stage, the company
is exploring opportunities of developing use cases for CGD
applications. A DFR is being prepared for setting up pilot facility
to blend Hydrogen with natural gas for industrial and applications
and to run Hydrogen powered FCEV buses.

Bases on positive outcome of the DFR, the company may set up
small scale pilot facility by FY27.

° + *

MGL's geographic expansion strategy is already yielding results,
particularly in GA3 (Raigad), which now contributes over 50% of
newly commissioned CNG stations and has seen a 50% surge
in PNG domestic connections. The acquisition of Unison Enviro
Private Limited (UEPL} has further expanded MGL'ss footprint into
new areas of Maharashtra and Karnataka, increasing its total
area under operation to “45,700 sq. km and positioning the
company to serve a growing proportion of Maharashtra’s urban
population and Karnataka’s industrial corridors.

The Company is actively diversifying its portfolio to capture
emerging opportunities in the energy sector. MGL’s joint venture,
MLPL formed to establish LNG stations for long-haul trucking,
positions it to capitalise on the rapidly growing LNG trucking
in India. MLPL has one operational station in Aurangabad,
Maharashtra & one station at Seoni, MP was mechanically
completed in the FY 2025. The company plans to commission

four LNG stations in FY 2026 and targets 26 operational stations
by 2030, with daily LNG sales expected to reach 1,35,000 kg by
2030, potentially generating over 1 (Cr. in daily revenue.

Looking ahead, MGL anticipates continued growth in the CGD
sector, driven by government initiatives to increase natural gas
consumption to 15% of India’s energy mix by 2030 as well as
compelling benefits of lower cost & lower emissions. There is
an increasing likelihood that diesel vehicle restrictions will be
imposed in major cities like Mumbai due to worsening pollution
levels which could further accelerate CNG demand. To capitalise

Story of a startup: By Mr. Vaibhav Kaushik,
CEO Nawgati

Nawgati’s real growth story began in 2022, when we teamed
up with MGL for a pilot at the Knhopat CNG station in Thane.
Back then we were a $4 million startup testing whether our
platform could truly quantify queues, identify fuelling bays,
track attendants through uniform recognition, monitor every
transaction and spot loyal customers. The pilot worked, the
data proved it and it gave us the credibility to think bigger.

In 2023, we took that same toolkit to 15 MGL COCO stations.
During this phase, we rolled out both the Nawgati Billing App
and our plug and play ANPR module almost in parallel, piping
dispenser data straight into the POS while automating vehicle
identification and compliance checks down to seconds. For the
CGD space it was a first, immediately tightening accuracy and
setting a new bar for transparent CNG operations.

MGL kept pushing boundaries. They launched queue-free
refuelling at select BEST depots using MGL Tez and also
allowed for slot booking through app, giving commercial
vehicles a taste of friction-less CNG refueling.

The partnership took centre stage again at CNG Mahotsav
2.0 in 2024. MGL asked Nawgati to run the event’s fleet
programme, so we built a closed-loop system that let MGL
load incentives via MGL coins and let fleet operators transact
using a physical and virtual card and track consumption in real
time. The execution showed the wider industry that digital fuel
management at scale is already possible.

Today, Nawgati is valued at roughly $36 million which is about
nine times where we started when MGL first gave us the pilot
opportunity. With additional deployments planned for other
locations this year, the collaboration is set to keep redefining
what efficient, transparent CNG retail can be.

Project PRISM

Working with MGL has shaped Nawgati more than any pitch
deck or demo day ever could. Their O&M, Marketing and R&T
teams opened up stations, compressors and dispensers for us to
dissect long before we had a full-strength ops crew. That early
access sharpened our tech and perhaps even more important
lent us the credibility only an industry leader can provide. Many
prospects took our calls simply because MGL did first.

From the first pilot through the simultaneous rollout of ANPR
and integrated billing, MGL kept challenging us to iterate and
trusted us enough to deploy. We are especially grateful to the
MGL leadership team for their vision, openness and steady
encouragement; their backing turned a young startup into a
recognised partner across the energy world in India.

Looking ahead, we’re gearing up to roll out the same plug-and-

play stack across India’s next wave of CNG corridors and to
pilot our Aaveg tech overseas. We’re excited to keep raising
the bar together and to set new benchmarks for India’s energy
and mobility sector.

RISE with SAP: Project Utkarsh

MGL became the first CGD company in India to go for
implementation of RISE with SAP on private cloud and SAP
ISU, transitioning from SAP ECC 6.0 to SAP S/4HANA. This
implementation preserves prior SAP investments while enabling
a seamless cloud transition. It lowers TCO with AWS-hosted
infrastructure and reduces IT complexity with SAP-managed
operations. The system supports on-demand upgrades and
custom extensibility for future innovations.

Innovation

Multi-Layered Composite (MLC)

MGL explored the usage of MLC pipes as an alternative to
copper tubes, aligning with the PNGRB Technical Standards
& Specifications including Safety Standards for City or Local
Natural Gas Distribution Networks (also known as T4S).

Besides enhancing safety, these MLC pipes increase productivity
and provide cost efficiencies of “25-30% as compared to
copper piping system. Further, by being chemically inert, these

pipes offer a longer service life thereby making them a budget-
friendly option.

Multi Coil Tubing (MCT)

MGL has introduced MCT technology at its Patalganga CNG
station, utilising stainless steel tubes to transport high-pressure
CNG without traditional RCC trench construction. Available in
longer lengths, MCT is quicker and easier to install, requires
fewer fittings and joints and reduces both installation and
maintenance costs. This approach allows for nearly trenchless
forecourt construction, improving station aesthetics and
safety by minimising fittings while maintaining conventional
manufacturing standards.

Prefab Building (PFB)

MGL has installed prefab sales offices at CNG outlets in Kalamboli,
Dombivali, Pen and Roha to accelerate execution and reduce costs.
Factory-made for precise quality, these structures are quickly
assembled onsite, minimising equipment use, material waste and
environmental impact. This innovation halves construction time
while delivering aesthetically appealing and sustainable buildings.

CRM

MGL believes in comprehensive customer service strategy to enhance convenience and engagement. The Company operates a 24/7

Call Centre, provides WhatsApp and email support, maintains a strong digital presence and manages 13 Walk-in Centres across its

service areas.

MGL'’s Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Department, supported by over 180 trained professionals, serves as the critical link
between customers and the Company through an omni-channel setup. In FY 2024-25, the key initiatives customer outreach campaigns

to raise awareness about fraudulent activities, extension of CRM services to CNG and commercial customers, introduction of WhatsApp
Live Chat for real-time query resolution and integration of robotic automation to streamline operations.

The Company also launched a new Walk-in Centre at Navy Nagar for Army and Navy officials as well as introduced QR code bill
payments and electronic feedback systems at its centres. MGL takes pride in building a CRM setup that has become an industry
benchmark, attracting visits from leading CGD companies seeking to adopt similar practices.

The Company partnered with Salesforce and Appstrail to implement Project PRISM, a CRM transformation initiative. The project aims
to establish a single customer view, break data silos and implement the Company's first Al-driven use case. The project kicked off in
January 2025, with the Business Requirement Document signed off in February 2025. While development is currently in progress, it
plans to go live in the third quarter of 2025.

Risk Management

MGL integrates robust risk management practices into its
operations to safequard stakeholder interests. Overseen by the

framework addresses risks across financial, operational, strategic
and regulatory domains. This structured approach enables MGL

The comprehensive and adaptive ERM framework incorporates
regular risk assessments and scenario analyses to identify,
assess and manage potential threats as well as allocate
resources effectively. Led by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO),
the risk evaluation aligns with MGLs financial objectives,
corporate strategy, statutory compliance, operational goals and
reporting requirements. Further, a collaborative ERM software
tool embeds the robust risk management practices across all

efficiently. By encouraging a culture of accountability and
maintaining a well-established governance structure, MGL

has been efficient in upholding resilience, trust and long-term
value creation.

Mitigation Strategies

« Financial Risks: Continuous monitoring of market
fluctuations and implementing mitigation actions to
address exposure.

° Operational Risks: Regular risk assessments, scenario
analyses and resource allocation for critical operations.

« Strategic Risks: Alignment of risk management processes
with corporate strategy to ensure adaptability.

« Regulatory Risks: Strict adherence to statutory compliance
and proactive engagement with regulatory bodies.

« Uncertainty Management: Implementation of ERM
software for real-time tracking, reporting and improvement
of risk processes.

This risk management framework ensures uninterrupted
operations and drives sustainable growth, even amidst a
competitive marketplace.

Exchange Rate Fluctuation

Gas contracts, especially long-term and spot LNG imports, are
denominated in US dollars (USD). So, when the local currency
depreciates against the dollar, LNG becomes more expensive
in local terms and vice versa. In such case CGD’s like your
Company, using LNG must pay more in local currency for the
same amount of gas when the local currency weakens.

Three options emerge in such eventuality. Either PNG and
CNG price maybe increased to pass on the higher input cost to
consumers or operating with reduced margins, if price increases
are not passed on to the consumer or cover the exchange rate
fluctuations through hedging. Studied view of this risk was taken
and it was decided to pass on the increased cost to the customer
in case of exchange rate fluctuations. This is better than taking a
upfront hedge cover in the long run as observed from the past data.

Internal Control System

The Company has strong internal control systems that align with
the complexities of its business operations, ensuring reliable
financial reporting, operational efficiency and compliance.
The Company thoroughly documents policies, procedures and
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), which are digitised
and integrated into business processes. These controls
undergo regular testing for design adequacy and operational
effectiveness by both internal and external auditors, ensuring
their functionality in practice.

Annual Report 2024-25

MAHANAGAR
GAS

STATE OF AFFAIRS OF THE COMPANY

Over the past three decades, your Company has made
remarkable progress in establishing city gas infrastructure across
India’s most densely populated metropolitan area. Developing
such infrastructure and ensuring efficient gas distribution in the
nation’s commercial capital necessitate robust safety protocols,
flawless project execution capabilities and dependable
operations. The Company has built strong core competencies
that not only support the city's ongoing energy needs but also
position it to meet the growing demands of a rapidly expanding
urban Landscape. With a vision to evolve into a diversified energy
enterprise, the Company has undertaken strategic initiatives
to both strengthen its core business and foray into emerging
sectors. These initiatives aim to unlock new revenue streams
and long-term growth. To realize this vision, the Company has
focused on targeted acquisitions, infrastructure development,
clean energy solutions and technological advancements.

Your Company has undertaken significant steps towards business
diversification by strategically investing in emerging energy
sectors. The acquisition of Unison Enviro Private Limited and entry
into the LNG retail segment through its joint venture Company
ie. Mahanagar LNG Private Limited ((MLPL’), underscore its
commitment to strengthening its presence across the natural
gas value chain and capitalizing on growth opportunities. As a
part of this initiative, MLPL commissioned its first LNG dispensing
station in Aurangabad during the year, with plans to expand
across key strategic locations in Maharashtra and other regions.
This development is well aligned with the Government's policy
direction to transition heavy-duty commercial vehicles from
diesel to LNG, thereby supporting India’s broader net-zero
emission goals.

Last year, your Company made a strategic entry into India’s
rapidly growing electric mobility sector through an investment
in 3EV Industries Private Limited, a manufacturer of electric
three-wheelers catering to both cargo and passenger segments.
Recognizing the increasing demand for lithium-ion (Li-ion) cells
in the mobility sector, the absence of large-scale domestic
manufacturing and the need to support India’s transition to
electric vehicles, your Company further strengthened its position
by committing to invest in Li-ion cell production through a Joint
Venture with International Battery Company, Inc. A 1 GWh cell
manufacturing facility is planned to be established in Bengaluru
in two phases. The plant will be technology-agnostic and will
initially produce prismatic NMC cells, primarily for the two-
wheeler market. In subsequent phases, the facility will scale up
to S GWh capacity, incorporating LFP and other chemistries to
meet evolving market demands.

Your Company is also advancing in setting up Compressed Biogas
(CBG) plant and securing CBG sourcing from other producers,

136

aligning with the CBG blending mandate. This initiative will
enhance domestic biofuel production, promote sustainability and
reduce imports.

In line with its sustainability goals, your Company is actively
working towards meeting its captive energy requirements through
renewable sources. To this end, it is in the process of identifying
a suitable partner for the development of a solar power plant.
Beyond fulfilling its internal energy needs, the Company is
also exploring broader business opportunities in the rapidly
evolving renewable energy sector. These initiatives are aimed at
strengthening its long-term competitiveness, particularly in the
emerging green hydrogen space over the next 5 to 10 years. As
part of this strategy, the Company plans to establish a pilot green
hydrogen project to build operational experience and develop
practical use cases. This initiative will support future applications
such as hydrogen blending into the pipeline network and direct
dispensing into hydrogen-powered vehicles.

While actively expanding into new and emerging energy domains,
MGL remains firmly committed to its core business of city gas
distribution. The Company is pursuing strategic acquisitions and
partnerships to broaden its geographical presence and leverage
the growing demand for CNG. Looking ahead, MGL’s focused
investments in LNG, green hydrogen, electric mobility and
renewable energy are set to enhance its role in driving India’s
energy transition. These initiatives will not only support long-
term growth but also reinforce the Company’s commitment to
sustainability and innovation.

Summary of Independent Impact Assessment studies
conducted in the financial year 2024-25

MGL CSR has completed impact assessments on eligible
CSR Projects. All the project budget costs are more than one

crore. The projects lie under the verticals of MGL Aarogya
and MGL Saksham. Some of the significant findings of the
assessments are all the project benefits reached to the
end beneficiaries, need base approach is visible, tie up
with local NGOs for smooth implementation of the program
and more focus is required on the active involvement of
indirect stakeholders with the objective of long-term project
sustainability and the quantum of communities’ collaboration
and cooperation towards the MGLs intervention is remarkable
and appreciable. Following are the highlights:

41. MGL Saksham: Swasthya Poshan Aahar Program

Objective: To provide free meals to the relatives/
attendants of the indoor patients at KEM
Hospital, Mumbai

Thematic Area: Poverty elevation
Intervention area: Mumbai

Insights:

e People are satisfied with the quantity of food
served and the meals are often fresh, hot and
nutritious. The served meals are unlimited and

147

MAHANAGAR
GAS

Mahanagar Gas Limited
Annual Report 2024-25

free of cost, as none of the attendants/ relatives
of the patients have ever been charged a single
cent for these meals.

. The major benefit of the food distribution
program is that people have been saving
money, which they are using for medicines and
diagnosis. Furthermore, for rural patients and
their relatives, this intervention has turned out to
be a significant relief.

. The volunteers should prioritize people with
passes in food distribution. Once all the pass
holders get food, then others such as OPD
patients should be served the food.

MGL Aarogya: Eye cataract surgery at
Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha

Objective: to provide various eye related procedures
at subsidized Cost to patients who belong to
economically weaker sections of society.

Thematic Area: Focuses on ensuring healthy lives
and promoting well-being for all at all ages.

Intervention area: Mumbai

Insights:

. The document screening team strictly abides
by all the criteria and rules set by the project.
Through rigorous document screening, the project
team indeed seeks to select genuine patients for
availing the benefits of subsidized surgery.

. The majority of the patients believe that these
health interventions have empowered them
to reengage in their livelihood activities so
that they could earn for their families. The
health interventions have provided support
and relief to the people, especially from lower
income categories who had been _ fighting
against their fate.

. Overall, the subsidized surgery program at
Shanmukhananda Health Center has proven to
be a valuable initiative that has made a tangible

Place : Mumbai
Date : June 03, 2025

148

difference in the lives of countless individuals. By
providing affordable and accessible healthcare,
the program has empowered patients, improved
their well-being and contributed to the overall
health and development of the community.

° The centre has been using updated technologies,
the latest machines and domain experts to reduce
the risks during and after surgery. This could be
one of the reasons for the high treatment costs at
the Shanmukhananda Health Care Centre.

3. MGL Sakhsham: Support to differently abled by
Sahayogini Palak Sanstha

Objective: Development and rehabilitation of children/
adults with multiple disabilities such as autism,
cerebral palsy and mental retardation etc to make
them self-reliant.

Thematic Area: Pre-admission Test, Individualized
Education Plan (IEP), Therapeutic Interventions and
Vocational Training and Education.

Intervention area: Mumbai and Thane
Insights:

° The pre-admission test is vital to analyse all
medical conditions and records of the students
and enrol them in the centre. The same test has
been used for each admission and no admission
to the centre has bypassed it.

° Regularity and consistency are key to retaining
what you learn and improve. Students attend
the centre twice a week at the most. A dedicated
open campus is sought to maintain consistency
and to improve students’ well-being.

° Therapeutic interventions have been
instrumental in improving the condition of the
children and ideally, a child should be considered
for one therapy per week; however, due to
the preference and priority (most vulnerable
children are prioritized) model, a child avails few
therapies per month.

Steps taken for conservation and _ utilizing
alternate sources of energy

MGL has set up Solar Power Plant at 12 MGL owned CNG
stations and Gas receiving terminals and MGL Admin office
at Mahape totaling to 200kw of power generation capacity.
Further, MGL plans to set up solar power facilities at MGL
owned CNG stations at Sion and Ghansoli as a green
initiative aimed at reducing power intake from the grid.

MGL has installed natural gas fueled Microturbine at the
MGLs Mahape Office to use it as primary power source for
office building and utilize its exhaust heat for centralised
air conditioning system of office building. This reduces
power intake from grid and utilises exhaust heat which is
otherwise wasted.

MGL has installed IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor)
based power factor correction panels at all MGL owned
CNG stations and STU (State Transport Utility) depots
to ensure power factor at desired level which ensures
optimum use of electrical energy from grid and avoid
burden on grid. All other CNG stations are also installed
with power factor correction panels which ensure optimum
utilisation of grid power.

MGL has completed deployment of 107 nos. of Type-3/ Type-
4 composite CNG cylinder cascades for CNG transportation.
These cascades have resulted in transporting more CNG
per trip, thereby reducing the number of trips and hence fuel
consumption. 53 nos. planned forthe financial year 2025-26.

Capital investment on energy conservation
equipment

Your Company has spent % 6.74 Lakh during the year on
installation of Solar Power Plant.

Technology Absorption:

1. A) New initiatives/ developments made towards
technology absorption:

The Company reviews the technological
obsolescence of installed equipment /
instruments and upgrade them, ensuring they
are the most advanced, dependable and secure
technologies available at the time.

B)

Following are the details of technologies
adopted by the MGL:

° Integrated Command and Control Center
at Mahape for overall operational
monitoring and control

° Real Time driving emission study for in-
service Diesel and CNG vehicle through
Automotive Research Association of India.

° Practical and cost-effective
data logger in DRS

° Replacement of higher sizes of diaphragm
gas meters with RPD meters

° Usage of Multi-Layered Composite (MLC)
pipes as a replacement of copper pipes

° Additional safety device incorporated
in service regulator modules, which will
function in the event of failure of the
service regulator

° Use of prefab cabin at CNG Retail Outlet at
Dombivali, Pen and Roha.

° Use of MCT (Multi Coil Tube} for carrying
CNG at CNG stations at Patalganga.

Benefits derived as a result of the above
initiatives/ developments in technology
absorption

° MGL has implemented Integrated Command
and Control Centre. It is a software platform
which has integrated existing functional
systems of MGL like SCADA, GIS, CTV
optimisation software, IVMS software, CNG
Station Forecourt Automation Software.
It further has capability to integrate with
SAP, AMR etc. at subsequent phase of
implementation.

° Generation of daily progress report of
O&M and dashboards for sales different
segments and reconciliation and analytics
of operational scenarios, health alerts for
compressors and dispensers.

Support to field teams during emergencies
like fire/gas leakage in terms of locating
nearest emergency handling team,
information on disrupted/affected area,
back-up resources etc.

Overall monitoring of operations at gas
receiving terminals, CNG stations etc.

Capability of system to integrate with
functions in new geographical areas which
are in process of acquisition and/or may get
added in future (once the assets in newer
areas get connected with MGL SCADA).

Better Accuracy meters offer better
volume measurement.

Facilitating better gas balancing of network.

Safe and effective operation of Gas
Supply Network.

Improvement in the existing business
processes and working standards of a City
Gas Distribution Project.

Effective inventory management.
Cost saving and energy saving.

Prefab cabin enhanced the speed of
execution with savings of 23% cost on
labour, materials, formwork & shuttering
against conventional building. This has also
helped to achieve desirable quality with
precise specifications.

Moreover, Prefab cabin has also added
in achieving aesthetically impressive
structures. Since these structures are made
in factory, they are swiftly assembled on
site with minimal equipment, thereby saving
both time & resources. It reduces onsite
material wastage and minimizing impact
on local environment, this construction
approach is more sustainable.

MCT is safe as it requires relatively less
no. of fittings/joints. It is easy and faster to
install and does not require RCC trench as
is required in conventional tubing.

Governance, leadership, and oversight

7. Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related challenges, targets and
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)

At MGL, we continue our steadfast commitment to addressing two of the most pressing challenges facing India — meeting
India’s growing energy demands for accelerating growth and reducing carbon emissions. As a leading player in the City Gas
Distribution (CGD) sector, MGL is dedicated to delivering innovative, low-carbon, and sustainable energy solutions across its
Geographical Areas (GAs) of Greater Mumbai, Urban Thane & Raigad District as well as the three GA's of our 100% subsidiary
M/s Unison Enviro Pvt Ltd viz Ratnagiri, Latur/Osmanabad in Maharashtra & Chitradurga /Davangere in Karnataka.

Natural gas remains at the core of our sustainability efforts, as we continue to promote eco-friendly energy sources. At the same
time, we place great emphasis on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles, ensuring that these pillars are deeply
embedded across our value chain & businesses. MGL has established an ESG policy to ensure good governance and promote
sustainability. This policy outlines our commitment to environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and transparent governance
practices, guiding our operations and decision-making to create long-term value for stakeholders and support a sustainable future

Our efforts are directed toward tackling key issues such as carbon emissions, environmental conservation, climate resilience,
and the protection of human rights. MGL’s governance structure is anchored by a robust framework, comprising empowered
statutory and non-statutory committees with clearly defined responsibilities. These committees, many of which report directly to
the Board, uphold our commitment to transparency, ethical conduct, and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

As one of the fastest-growing large economies, India has committed to achieving Net Zero emissions by 2070. Currently, Natural
Gas comprises approximately ~715% of the country’s energy mix (as per Niti Aayog), with a target to increase this share to 15%
by 2030. In alignment with this national goal, MGL is scaling up its operations to further promote the adoption of natural gas — a
cleaner, greener, and more efficient fuel alternative. Its usage significantly reduces the carbon footprint, making it a

much cleaner and efficient fuel option. MGL has been supplying PNG & CNG at rates comparable /lesser than competing fuels
like LPG, Petrol & Diesel thereby reducing the barriers and creating better access to the customers (Households, Industries,
Commercial establishment & Vehicle owners} and promoting affordability.

LNG as automotive fuel

To address the decarbonization of the long-haul trucking (which is one of the biggest source of vehicular emissions), MGL, through
its JV, Mahanagar LNG Private Limited (“MLPL” incorporated in December 2023) commissioned its ist LNG Station in Aurangabad
in October 2024 & technically commissioned its 2nd LNG station at Seoni (MP). MLPL has plans to commission additional 3 LNG
stations(at Amravati, Bhiwandi & JNPT) in FY 25-26. These LNG stations along with MGL’s existing LNG station at Savroli,our JV
Partner, M/s Baidyanath LNG Pvt Ltd.’s 3 stations & other CGD’s stations across Maharashtra will spearhead the shift of the long
haul trucking to LNG as a fuel in Maharashtra. Additionally, MLPL is also working with various OEM’s & Fleet owners to expand the
LNG ecosystem thereby “Greening” the Long haul trucking market.

Li-ion battery venture

India’s Li-ion battery market is poised for rapid growth, with demand projected to reach 250 GWh by 2030. Currently, the country
remains heavily dependent on China for Li-ion battery cells used in battery pack manufacturing. To address this critical supply
gap and to support decarbonization of the mobility segment, MGL has partnered with International Battery Company, Inc. (USA)
through a JV- International Battery Company India Pvt. Ltd. to establish a Giga factory in Bangalore. The facility will be technology
agnostic and will initially manufacture prismatic NMC Li-ion cells, targeting applications in 2 & 3 wheeler electric vehicles (EVs) as
well as Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) in India.

MGL as part of its committed investment of ¥ 350 crore in the giga plant, has already disbursed % 35 crore in January 2025.
Land for the project has been secured from Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB). The initial SOO MW facility is
expected to get commissioned in Q1 of FY 27. The capacity would later be scaled up to 5 GWh based on market requirement. It is
worthwhile to mention that International Battery Company, USA has already established a pilot Li-ion cell manufacturing facility
at South Korea for manufacture of prismatic NMC cells & these cells are being supplied to Indian EV manufacturers for extensive

3EV

Electric Vehicles (EVs) are rapidly gaining momentum, particularly in the three-wheeler segment. This growth is primarily driven by
increasing demand for Last-mile logistics from companies like Amazon, Flipkart, Porter, Big Basket etc. To support this transition,
MGL had invested in 3EV Industries Pvt. a Bangalore-based manufacturer of L5-category electric three-wheelers. MGL had
committed investment of = 96 Cr. in four tranches and, till date, had invested % 73 Cr. of which = 23 Cr. as third tranche was
disbursed in March 2025, taking the total holding of MGL to approximately 24.5% in the company. Post receipt of investment from
MGL, 3EV has demonstrated significantly better performance, with revenue increasing by ~200% & vehicle sales by ~90% in FY
25.

Other Significant Measures

During the year, MGL installed Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) at City Gate Stations (CGS) at Mahape and Ambernath. These STP’s
collect, treat, and discharge wastewater, providing a service essential to environmental and public health thereby eliminating the
possibility of sewage leaching into subsoil and contaminating ecosystems. Also, during the year, MGL implemented Rainwater
Harvesting system at CGS Mahape and Taloja for collecting and storage of rainwater, rather than allowing it to run off and utilizing
it for gardening purposes as well as for replenishing ground water.

MGL drives the business with the utmost safety measures and in adherence with its Health Safety and Environment policy.
Customers are kept at the center of business operations. Every necessary step is taken to ensure that customers get the best
services without any disruptions. MGL also has in place Enterprise Risk Management policy, which is the guidance for critical
decision making to mitigate the business Risk.

MGL has been able to reverse the increasing trend of LUAG (Lost & Unaccounted Gas). LUAG had been increasing by an
average of 0.34.% every year while this year we are successful in reducing LUAG by 0.4%; thereby reducing it from 2.7% in
FY:2023-24 to 2.3% in FY:2024-25.

MGL had signed MOU with BMC to setup 1000 tons per day CBG plant in June 2023.The proposal for allocation of land at Deonar

empowerment, MGL Vidya for education, MGL Haribala for environmental sustainability, MGL Hunar for skill development and
MGL Saathi for other social initiatives. Our CSR initiatives cover 15 out of 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Under MGL Vikas, the company undertook holistic rural development programs across 21 villages in Raigad district, focusing on
improving access to education, healthcare and sustainable livelihoods. These interventions aimed to uplift communities and foster
long-term socio-economic growth.

56,000 saplings were planted across four locations, contributing to increased green cover, biodiversity restoration and climate
resilience.

Through MGL Aarogya, MGL donated TruNAAT machines and ultra-portable handheld X-ray machines for tuberculosis (TB)
detection. These machines enhanced diagnostic accuracy and speed, especially in high-burden areas & remote areas of Raigad
district covering “12,000 citizens. Out of 11,941 tests conducted, 843 TB-positive cases were identified and treated. Resulting in
early diagnosis of “800 patients who received timely treatment. Through many such CSR initiatives, MGL continues to create a
lasting, positive impact in the communities it serves, reflecting its dedication to inclusive growth and sustainability.

Internal Orientation

MGL organized a Nature Trail for employees at BNHS (Bombay Natural History Society) Reserve in Goregaon to emphasis
importance of biodiversity reflecting MGLs commitment to biodiversity conservation, ecological awareness, and sustainable
development. By engaging employees and stakeholders in such activities, MGL fosters a deeper understanding of environmental
preservation while reinforcing its ESG efforts. MGL also promoted responsible e-waste disposal by installing collection bins
at select offices for 15 days. The initiative successfully collected 50 Kilograms of e-waste, demonstrating our commitment to
environmental sustainability.

As part of MGL’s continued commitment to integrating ESG principles across its operations, a focused training program on ESG was
conducted for around 200 employees. This initiative aimed to enhance awareness, build internal capabilities, and foster a culture
of sustainability and responsible governance within the organization. The training covered ESG principles, including climate action,
resource efficiency, ethical business practices, stakeholder engagement, and regulatory compliance. By empowering employees
with the knowledge and tools to incorporate ESG considerations into their daily roles, MGL is strengthening its foundation for long-
term sustainable growth and aligning its workforce with global best practices.

instituted a robust framework for the selection of projects. A mandatory part of the framework is a visit by MGLs official to the
proposed community/ site to gauge the community's needs, enthusiasm, and acceptance of the proposed intervention. MGL has
implemented various new interventions on a pilot basis and then scaled them up, based on a review of the project. Further, MGL
has also adopted a robust in-house monitoring strategy. Additionally, an app-based monitoring system is implemented to get
live data as and when required. Regular monitoring visits are carried out to ensure that the project is implemented in line with the
stakeholders' expectations. The sustainability of CSR intervention is an important consideration and the community’s involvement
is elicited right from the inception. People’s institutions are formed and strengthened to ensure that the impact created is sustained
post-exit of the Company from the intervention. MGL CSR also believes in and undertakes coordinated efforts and works closely
with other CSR entities, Government agencies, and international organizations in the country to create a learning and sharing
environment in the social development space. This has resulted in covering more underserved communities in thematic areas like
preventive health care, primary education, disability, women empowerment, skill development, and environment conservation.

Independent Auditor’s Report

To The Members of Mahanagar Gas Limited

Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial
Statements

Opinion

We have audited the accompanying standalone financial
statements of Mahanagar Gas Limited (the “Company”), which
comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, and the
Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive
Income}, the Statement of Cash Flows and the Statement of
Changes in Equity for the year ended on that date, and notes
to the financial statements, including a summary of material
accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to
the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial
statements give the information required by the Companies Act,
2013 (the “Act”} in the manner so required and give a true and
fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards
prescribed under section 133 of the Act, (“Ind AS”) and other
accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of
affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2025, and its profit, total
comprehensive income, its cash flows and the changes in equity
for the year ended on that date.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in
accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SA’s) specified under

Key Audit Matter

Slow moving/non-moving Projects lying in Capital
Work-in-Progress

{as described in note 2.2(b) of the material accounting policies,
and note 3 for details and movement in capital work-in-progress
in the standalone financial statements)

As at March 31, 2025, the Company has %974.15 crore of capital
work-in-progress. The Company’s spending on capital work-in-
progress is material as indicated by the total value as at date. The
assessment and the timing of recognition of asset, as to whether
the asset is in the location and condition necessary for it to be
capable of operating in the manner intended by management
as set out in Ind AS 16, ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’, requires
judgement and is dependent on the completion of projects after
obtaining all necessary approvals.

section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards
are further described in the Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of
the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are
independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI’)
together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our
audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions
of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements
and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence
obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion on the standalone financial statements.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone
financial statements of the current period. These matters were
addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have
determined the matters described below to be the key audit
matters to be communicated in our report.

Auditor's Response

Our audit procedures performed among others included the
following:

We assessed the design and implementation and tested the
operating effectiveness of key financial controls over the
management review of capital work-in-progress.

We obtained the list of projects where there is delay in
capitalisation along with the reasons of the delay and the
expected capitalization dates from the management.

For assets capitalized during the year, we considered the
planned vs actual capitalization dates to test the management’s
assessment of expected capitalization dates.

243

Mahanagar Gas Limited
Annual Report 2024-25

MAHANAGAR
GAS

Key Audit Matter

The Company has slow moving / non-moving projects lying in
capital work-in- progress amounting to 92.50 crore where there
is significant delay in capitalisation because of several external
factors. As a result, this is considered as a key audit matter, with
focus on certain slow moving/non-moving projects, where the
tisk of assessment of impairment of such items was deemed
higher because of the complexity of the specific projects and
the delays involved.

Auditor's Response

We tested management's assessment of indicators of
impairment of old projects and the estimated allowance created
and write offs made in the current year basis the policy on slow
moving and non-moving projects as approved by the Board. We
have tested the appropriateness of categorizing the projects as
slow and non-moving basis the expected period of completion
as determined by the Company.

For old projects capitalized during the year, we tested on
sample basis to determine that the useful life of the asset was
adjusted to reflect the wear and tear of such assets.

We evaluated the disclosures in the standalone
financial statements.

Information Other than the Financial Statements and
Auditor’s Report Thereon

° The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the
other information. The other information comprises the
information included in the Director’s report, Business
responsibility report, Management Discussion and Analysis
and Corporate Governance report, but does not include
the consolidated financial statements, standalone financial
statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

° Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does
not cover the other information and we do not express any
form of assurance conclusion thereon.

° In connection with our audit of the standalone financial
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information
is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial
statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of
our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

° If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that
there is a material misstatement of this other information,
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to
report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management and Board of
Directors for the Standalone Financial Statements

The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters
stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation
of these standalone financial statements that give a true
and fair view of the financial position, financial performance
including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes
in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting

244

principles generally accepted in India, including Ind AS specified
under section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes
maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the
Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other
irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting
policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance
of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation
of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the standalone financial statements, management
and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either
intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has
no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Company’s Board of Directors is also responsible for
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone
Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that
an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise

from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these standalone financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism
throughout the audit. We also:

. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of
the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

. Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls
relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section
143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing
our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal
financial controls with reference to standalone financial
statements in place and the operating effectiveness
of such controls.

e Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
related disclosures made by the management.

e Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of
the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty
exists related to events or conditions that may cast
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's
report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the
Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

e Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content
of the standalone financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the standalone financial
statements represent the underlying transactions and
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Corporate Statutory Financial
Overview Reports $tatements
al al Sel

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the standalone
financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes
it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably
knowledgeable user of the standalone financial statements
may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and
qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work
and in evaluating the results of our work; and {ii) to evaluate
the effect of any identified misstatements in the standalone
financial statements.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding,
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies
in internal financial controls that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements
regarding independence, and to communicate with them
all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable,
related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with
governance, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

1. As required by Section 143(3) of the Act, based on our audit
we report that:

a) We have sought and obtained all the information and
explanations which to the best of our knowledge and
belief were necessary for the purposes of our audit.

b) In our opinion, proper books of account as required
by law have been kept by the Company so far as it
appears from our examination of those books.

c) The Balance Sheet, the Statement of Profit and
Loss including Other Comprehensive Income, the
Statement of Cash Flows and Statement of Changes
in Equity dealt with by this Report are in agreement
with the relevant books of account.

(Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date)

Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference
to standalone financial statements under Clause (i) of
Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act,
2013 (the “Act”)

We have audited the internal financial controls with reference
to standalone financial statements of Mahanagar Gas Limited
(the “Company”) as at March 31, 2025 in conjunction with
our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements of the
Company for the year ended on that date.

Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities
for Internal Financial Controls

The Company’s management and Board of Directors are
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial
controls with reference to standalone financial statements based
on the internal control with reference to standalone financial
statements criteria established by the Company considering the
essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial
Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of
India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that
were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient
conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company’s
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness
of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable
financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's
internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial
statements of the Company based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance
Note”} issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India
and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10}
of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of
internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial
statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate

248

internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial
statements was established and maintained and if such controls
operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence
about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with
reference to standalone financial statements and their operating
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with
reference to standalone financial statements included obtaining
an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to
standalone financial statements, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on
the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to
standalone financial statements.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference
to standalone financial statements

A company's internal financial control with reference to
standalone financial statements is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company's internal financial control
with reference to standalone financial statements includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorisations of management and
directors of the company; and (3} provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls
with reference to standalone financial statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls
with reference to standalone financial statements, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur
and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial
statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the
internal financial control with reference to standalone financial
statements may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion
In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to

the explanations given to us the Company has, in all material
respects, an adequate internal financial controls with reference

to standalone financial statements and such internal financial

statements established by the Company considering the essential
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on

when stated otherwise. Amounts less than 750,000 have been
presented as °#”

2. Summary of Material accounting policies

This note provides a list of the material accounting policies
adopted in the preparation of these Standalone financial
statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all
the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

21 Basis of preparation
a. Statement of Compliance

The Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with the accounting principles generally
accepted in India including Indian Accounting
Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under the section 133
of the Companies Act, 2013 read with rule 3 of the
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards} Rules, 2015
(as amended from time to time) and presentation and
disclosures requirement of Division Il of Schedule Ill of
the Companies Act 2013, (Ind AS Compliant Schedule
{I}, as applicable to financial statements.

Accordingly, the Company has prepared these
Financial Statements which comprise the Balance
Sheet as at March 31, 2025, the Statement of Profit and
Loss, the Statement of Cash Flows and the Statement
of Changes in Equity for the year ended March 31,
2025, and material accounting policies and other

explanatory information (together hereinafter referred
to as “financial statements”)

Historical cost convention

The financial statements have been prepared on a
historical cost convention and on an accrual basis,
except for certain items that are measured at fair
value at the end of each reporting period as required
by relevant Ind AS:

. Financial assets and financial liabilities
measured at fair value (Refer accounting policy
on financial Instruments};

. Defined benefit and other long-term
employee benefits.

Current vs Non-Current Classification:

The Company presents assets and liabilities in
the balance sheet based on current/ non-current
classification.

An asset is treated as current when it satisfies any of
the following criteria:

e it is expected to be realized in, or is intended for
sale or consumption in, the Company’s normal
operating cycle,

e it is held primarily for the purpose of trading,

e it is expected to be realised within 12 months
after the reporting date, or

e it is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted
from being exchanged or used to settle a liability
for at least 12 months after the reporting date.

All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is treated as current when it satisfies any of
the following criteria:

e it is expected to be settled in the Company’s
normal operating cycle,

e It is held primarily for the purpose of trading,

. It is due to be settled within twelve months after
the reporting period, or

259

MAHANAGAR
GAS

Mahanagar Gas Limited
Annual Report 2024-25

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

for the year ended March 31, 2025

260

@ the Company does not have an unconditional
right to defer settlement of the liability for at least
12 months after the reporting date.

All other liabilities are classified as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified
as non-current.

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition
of assets for processing and their realisation in cash
and cash equivalents.

Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity
with Ind AS requires the management to make estimates,
judgements and assumptions. These estimates,
judgments and assumptions affect the application of
accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the period. The application of accounting policies that
require critical accounting estimates involving complex
and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions
in these financial statements have been disclosed
in Note no. 219. Accounting estimates could change
from period to period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. Appropriate changes in estimates are
made as management becomes aware of changes in
circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes
in estimates are reflected in the financial statements
in the period in which changes are made and, if
material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the
financial statements.

Business Combinations

Business combinations are accounted for using
the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition
is measured as the aggregate of the consideration
transferred measured at fair value on acquisition
date. The amount of any non-controlling interests
in the acquiree for each business combination,
the Company elects whether to measure the non-
controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at
the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable
net assets. Acquisition-related costs as and when
incurred are expensed.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets
acquired, and the liabilities assumed are recognised at
their fair values on acquisition date. For this purpose,
the liabilities assumed include contingent Liabilities
representing present obligation and they are measured
at fair values on acquisition date irrespective of the
fact that outflow of resources embodying economic
benefits is not probable. However, the following assets
and liabilities acquired in a business combination are
measured at the basis indicated below:

. Deferred tax assets or Liabilities and potential tax
effects of temporary differences and carry forwards
of an acquiree that exist at the acquisition date or
arise because of the acquisition are accounted in
accordance with Ind AS 12-Income Tax.

e The assets or liabilities related to employee benefit
arrangements are recognised and measured in
accordance with Ind AS 19-Employee Benefits.

. Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as
held for sale and Non-current Assets Held for
Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured
in accordance with Ind AS 105-Non-current Assets
Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.

Investment in subsidiaries, joint ventures and
associates

i The Company has accounted for its investment
in subsidiaries at cost. The company assesses
whether there is any indication that these
investments may be impaired. If any such
indication exists, the investment is considered for
impairment based on the fair value thereof.

ji. When the Company issues financial guarantees
on behalf of subsidiaries, initially it measures
the financial guarantee at their fair values and
subsequently measures at higher of:

. The amount of Loss allowance determined in
accordance with impairment requirements
of Ind AS 109 and

e The amount initially recognized less, when
appropriate, the cumulative amount of
income recognized in accordance with
the principles of Ind AS 115 ‘Revenue from
Contracts with Customers’

iii. The financial statements of the Company’s
subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting
period as the Company. (When necessary,
adjustments are made to bring the accounting
policies in line with those of the Group.)

g. Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new
standards or amendments to the existing standards
under Companies {Indian Accounting Standards) Rules
as issued from time to time. For the year ended March
31, 2025, MCA has notified Ind AS — 117 Insurance
Contracts and amendments to Ind AS 116 — Leases,
relating to sale and leaseback transactions, applicable
to the Company w.e-f. April 1, 2024. The Company has
reviewed the new pronouncements and based on its
evaluation has determined that it does not have any
significant impact in its financial statements.

2.2. Property, plant and equipment

An item of property, plant and equipment (PPE) that qualifies
as an asset is measured on initial recognition at cost.
Following initial recognition, all items of property, plant and
equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation
and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition or
construction of the items. Subsequent costs are added to
existing item’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate
item, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future
economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the
Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other subsequent costs related to an item are charged to
the statement of profit and loss during the reporting period in
whichthey are incurred. In case of commissioned assets where
final payment to the contractors is pending, capitalisation is
made on provisional basis subject to necessary adjustment
in cost and depreciation in the year of settlement.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are
expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any
gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of
property, plant and equipmentis determined as the difference
between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the
asset and is recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss.

a. Commissioning

Gas distribution systems are treated as commissioned
when supply of gas reaches to the individual points
and ready for intended use.

Capital work-in-progress (CWIP)

Capital Work-in-Progress includes, material, labour
and other directly attributable costs incurred on
assets, which are yet to be commissioned. Capital
Inventory is included in Capital work-in-progress and
comprises stock of capital items and construction
materials at Company’s stores and with contractors.

The Company has provisioning policy for slow and
non-moving CWIP (Refer note 2.19).

Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and
residual value

Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
method to allocate cost of the asset, net of estimated
residual value, over their estimated useful lives. The
useful lives and residual values are as prescribed
under schedule Il to Companies Act, 2013, except
in respect of, following category of property plant
and equipment where useful life estimated as
per management estimate is based on technical
advice, taking into account the nature of the asset,
replacements generally required from the point of
view of operational effectiveness:

Type of assets Useful lives
CNG Compressors and Dispensers 10 Years
CNG Cascades 20 Years
Underground pipeline network 25 Years
Intangible assets (Softwares/Licenses) 6 Years
Furniture provided for the use of 6 Years
employees
Electrical Equipment provided for the 4 Years

use of employees

The residual values and useful lives of the assets are
reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of
each reporting period.

Depreciation on the property, plant and equipment
added / disposed off / discarded during the year is
provided on pro-rata basis with reference to the time
of addition/disposal/discarding.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by
comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These
are included in the statement of profit and loss under
Other Expenses.

d. On transition to Ind AS, the company had elected to
continue with the carrying value of all its property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets recognised
as at April 01, 2015 measured as per previous GAAP
and use that carrying value as deemed cost of
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

2.2.1 Goodwill and Other Intangible assets

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially
measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration
transferred over the net identifiable assets acquired
and liabilities assumed, in accordance with Ind AS 103

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured
on initial recognition at cost. Intangible assets arising
on acquisition of business are measured at fair value
as at date of acquisition.

Impairment of assets

The carrying values of assets/cash generating units at
each balance sheet date are reviewed for impairment. The
cash generating unit is the group of asset that generates
identified independent Cash Flows. If any indication of
impairment exists, the recoverable amount of such assets
is estimated and impairment is recognised, if the carrying
amount of these assets exceeds their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value
less costs of disposal and their value in use. Value in use
is arrived at by discounting the future cash flows to their
present value based on an appropriate discount factor.
When there is indication that an impairment loss recognised
for an asset in earlier accounting periods no longer exists
or may have decreased, such reversal of impairment loss is
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In
determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market
transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions
can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.

Leases

The Company assesses at contract inception whether
a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract
conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for
a period of time in exchange for consideration.

The Company as a lessee

The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of
leases for land and buildings, motor vehicles, plant and
equipment and computers. The Company assesses whether
a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. To
assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the
use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether:
(i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii} the
Company has substantially all the economic benefits from
use of the asset throughout the period of the lease and {iii)
the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company
recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding
lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a
lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or
less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these
short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes
the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-
line basis over the term of the lease.

Certain lease arrangements include the options to extend or
terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU
assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is
reasonably certain that they will be exercised.

The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost,
which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability
adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the
commencement date of the lease. They are subsequently
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and
impairment Losses.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement
date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease
term and useful life of the underlying asset. Right of use
assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying
amounts may not be recoverable.

For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable
amount {i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell
and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset
basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that
are largely independent of those from other assets. In such
cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash
Generating Unit (CGU} to which the asset belongs.

2.5

The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost
at the present value of the future lease payments. The
lease payments are discounted using the interest rate
implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using
the incremental borrowing rates. Lease liabilities are
remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related
right of use asset if the Company changes its assessment if
whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.

Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately
presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have
been classified as financing cash flows.

Investments and other financial assets
a. Classification

The Company classifies its financial assets in the
following measurement categories:

« those to be measured subsequently at fair value
(either through other comprehensive income, or
through profit or loss), and

e those measured at amortised cost.

The classification depends on the Company’s
business model for managing the financial assets and
the contractual terms of the cash flows.

For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses
will either be recorded in profit or loss or other
comprehensive income. For investments in debt and
equity instruments, this will depend on the business
model in which the investment is held.

The Company reclassifies its investments when and
only when its business model for managing those
assets changes.

Assets that are held for collection of contractual
cash flows where those cash flows represent sole
payment of principal and interest are measured at
amortised cost.

Investments in mutual funds are primarily held for the
Company's cash requirements and can be readily
convertible in cash. These investments are initially
recognised at fair value and carried at fair value
through profit or loss (FVTPL).

A financial asset is classified as FVTOCI only if it
meets both the of the following conditions and is not
recognized at FVTPL:

. The asset is held within a business model
whose objective is achieved by both
collecting contractual cash flows and selling
financial assets; and

. The contractual terms of the financial asset give
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the
principal amount outstanding.

Financial Asset included within the FVTOCI category
are measured initially as well as at each reporting date
at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in
the other comprehensive income (OCI). However, the
Company recognizes interest income, impairment
losses & reversals in the Statement of Profit and Loss,
if any. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain
or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified
from the equity to Statement of Profit and Loss.

Initial recognition and measurement

All financial assets are recognised initially at fair
value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable
to the acquisition or issue of financial asset (other
than financial asset at fair value through Profit or
Loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value
of the financial assets, as appropriate on_ initial
recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to
the acquisition of financial assets at fair value through
the Statement of Profit and Loss are recognised
immediately in Statement of Profit and Loss.

Subsequent measurement

All recognised financial assets are subsequently
measured in their entirety at either amortized cost or
‘fair value through profit or loss’ or ‘fair value through
other comprehensive income’, depending on the
classification of the financial asset.

Impairment of financial assets

The company assesses on a forward looking basis the
expected credit losses (ECL} associated with its assets
carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology
applied depends on whether there has been a

263

MAHANAGAR
GAS

Mahanagar Gas Limited
Annual Report 2024-25

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

for the year ended March 31, 2025

264

significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables,
except for specifically identified cases, the Company
follows a simplified approach where provision is made
as per the ageing buckets which are designed based
on historical facts and patterns. For refundable security
deposits and reinstatement charges recoverable with
government authorities, the company recognises
impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at
each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.
Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting
from all possible default events over the expected life of
a financial instrument. ECL is the difference between all
contractual cash flows that are due to the Company in
accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that
the company expects to receive (i.e., all cash shortfalls),
discounted at the original Effective Interest Rate (EIR).

ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal)
recognized during the period is recognized as income/
expense in the statement of profit and loss (P&L). This
amount is reflected under the head ‘other expenses’
in the P&L. The balance sheet presentation for various
financial instruments is described below:

Financial assets measured as at amortised cost: ECL
is presented as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part
of the measurement of those assets in the balance
sheet. The allowance reduces the net carrying amount.
Until the asset meets write-off criteria, the Company
does not reduce impairment allowance from the gross
carrying amount.

For assessing increase in credit risk and impairment
loss, the Company combines financial instruments on
the basis of shared credit risk characteristics with the
objective of facilitating an analysis that is designed
to enable significant increases in credit risk to be
identified on a timely basis.

De-recognition of financial assets
A financial asset is de-recognised only when

. The Company has transferred the rights to
receive cash flows from the financial asset or

. retains the contractual rights to receive the
cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a
contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to
one or more recipients.

Where the Company has transferred an asset, the
Company evaluates whether it has transferred
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the
financial asset. In such cases, the financial asset is de-
recognised. Where the Company has not transferred
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the
financial asset, the financial asset is not de-recognised.

Where the Company has neither transferred a financial
asset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of
ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is
de-recognised if the Company has not retained control
of the financial asset. Where the Company retains
control of the financial asset, the asset is continued to
be recognised to the extent of continuing involvement
in the financial asset.

2.5.4 Cash and cash equivalents

For the purpose of presentation in the statement
of cash flows, Cash and cash equivalents includes
cash on hand, cash in transit and short term deposits
with original maturities of three months or less that
are readily convertible to known amounts of cash
and which are subject to an insignificant risk of
changes in value.

2.6 Financial Liabilities

a. Classification as debt or equity

Debt and equity instruments issued by Company are
classified as either financial liabilities or as equity
in accordance with the substance of the contractual
arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability
and an equity instrument.

b. Measurement

Financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value
and are subsequently measured at amortised cost
using effective interest method or at FVTPL

c. Financial liabilities subsequently measured at
amortised cost

Financial liabilities that are not held-for-trading and
are not designated as at FVTPL are measured at
amortised cost at the end of subsequent accounting
periods. The carrying amounts of financial liabilities
that are subsequently measured at amortised cost are
determined based on the effective interest method.

Interest expense that is not capitalised as part of costs
of an asset is included in the ‘Finance Cost’ line item.

The effective interest method is a method of
calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability
and of allocating interest expense over the relevant
period. The effective interest rate is the rate that
exactly discounts estimated future cash payments
(including all fees and points paid or received that
form an integral part of the effective interest rate,
transaction costs and other premiums or discounts)
through the expected life of the financial liability, or
(where appropriate) a shorter period, to the gross
carrying amount on initial recognition.

De-recognition of financial liabilities

The Company derecognises financial Liabilities
when, and only when, the Company's obligations are
discharged, cancelled or have expired. An exchange
between with a lender of debt instruments with
substantially different terms is accounted for as an
extinguishment of the original financial liability and
the recognition of a new financial liability. Similarly,
a substantial modification of the terms of an existing
financial liability (whether or not attributable to the
financial difficulty of the debtor) is accounted for as
an extinguishment of the original financial liability
and the recognition of a new financial liability. The
difference between the carrying amount of the
financial liability de-recognised and the consideration
paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss.

Security Deposit

Securities deposits from customers of natural gas,
refundable on termination / alteration of the gas sales
agreement are considered as current liabilities, as
every customer has a right to request for termination of
supply and the Company does not have a contractual
right to delay payment for more than 12 months.

Trade and other payables

These amounts represent liabilities for goods and
services received by the Company prior to the end of
reporting period which are unpaid. Trade and other
payables are presented as current liabilities unless
payment is not due within 12 months after the reporting
period. They are recognised initially at their fair value
and subsequently measured at amortised cost.

2.7. Fair Value Measurements

The Company measures financial instruments such as
derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a Liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability
takes place either:

{a} In the principal market for the asset or Liability, or

{b} In the absence of a principal market, in the most
advantageous market for the asset or Liability.

The principal or the most advantageous market must be
accessible by the Company.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using
the assumptions that market participants would use
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market
participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into
account a market participant’s ability to generate economic
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by
selling it to another market participant that would use the
asset in its highest and best use.

The Company uses valuation techniques that are
appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient
data are available to measure fair value, maximising the
use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of
unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured
or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement as a whole:

e Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities that the
company can access at the measurement date;

e Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices
included within level 1 that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and

2.10

266

. Level 3- Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the
asset or liability.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the
financial statements on a recurring basis, the company
determines whether transfer have occurred between
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization
(based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the
fair value measurement as a whole} at the end of each
reporting period.

Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in
this financial information is determined on such a basis,
except for share-based payment transactions that are
within the scope of Ind AS 102, leasing transactions that are
within the scope of Ind AS 17, and measurements that have
some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as
net realisable value in Ind AS 2 or value in use in Ind AS 36.

Offsetting financial instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net
amount is reported in the balance sheet where there is a
legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts
and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Inventories

Stock of gas is valued at lower of cost computed on First In
First Out (FIFO) basis and estimated net realisable value.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the
ordinary course of business, less estimated costs ofcompletion
and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

Inventories other than stock of gas are valued at cost,
which is determined on weighted average net off provision
for cost of obsolescence / slow moving inventory and other
anticipated losses, wherever considered necessary.

Cost ofinventories includes allother costs incurred in bringing
the inventories to their present Location and condition.

Revenue from contracts with customers

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when
control of the goods or services are transferred to the
customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to
which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for
those goods or services.

211

2412

The disclosures of significant accounting judgements,
estimates and assumptions relating to revenue from
contracts with customers are provided in Note 2.19

The Company earns revenues primarily from sale of natural
gas. Revenue is recognised on supply of gas to customers
by metered/assessed measurements. The Company
has concluded that it is the principal in all its revenue
arrangements since it is the primary obligor in all the
revenue arrangements as it has the pricing latitude and is
also exposed to credit risk.

However, sales tax/ value added tax (VAT} / Goods and
Service Tax (GST} is not received by the Company on its
own account. Rather, it is tax collected on value added to
the commodity by the seller on behalf of the government.
Accordingly, it is excluded from revenue.

Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is
measured at the amount of transaction price (net of variable
consideration) allocated to that performance obligation. The
transaction price of goods sold and service rendered is net
of variable consideration on account of trade allowances,
rebates, value added tax, goods and service tax (GST) and
inclusive of excise duty.

Compensation receivable from customers with respect
to shortfall in minimum guaranteed Off take of gas is
recognised on contractual basis. Delayed payment
charges are recognised on receipt basis in view of
uncertainty of collection.

Interest and Dividend income

Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when
it is probable that the economic benefit will flow to the
Company and the amount of income can be measured
reliably. Interest income is accrued on time basis, by
reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective
interest rate applicable.

Dividend income from investments is recognised when the
right to receive dividend has been established.

Foreign currencies

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the
functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates
of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses
resulting from the settlement of such transactions and
from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities

Corporate Statutory Financial
Overview Reports Statements
al al Sel

Notes to Standalone Financial Statements

213

denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange
rates are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. At the
end of each reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the
functional currency spot rates prevailing at the reporting date.

Foreign exchange differences regarded as an adjustment to
borrowing costs are presented in the statement of profit and
loss, within finance costs. All other foreign exchange gains
and losses are presented in the statement of profit and loss
on d net basis within other gains/losses).

Income tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for
the year. Taxable profit differs from "profit before tax" as
reported in the statement of profit and loss because of items
of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other
years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The
Company's current tax is calculated using tax rates that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of
the reporting period. Income tax assets and liabilities are
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or
paid to the taxation authorities.

Current Tax

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of
the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end
of the reporting period. Management periodically evaluates
positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in
which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of
amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred Tax

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability
method, on temporary differences arising between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in
the financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined
using tax rates {and laws) that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period
and are expected to apply when the related deferred
income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax
liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible
temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is
probable that future taxable amounts will be available to
utilise those temporary differences and losses.

214

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is
a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and
liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the
same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities
are offset where the company has a legally enforceable
right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or
to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Current and deferred tax is recognised in Statement of
Profit and Loss, except to the extent that it relates to items
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly
in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

Uncertain tax positions

The management periodically evaluates positions taken in
the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable
tax regulations are subject to interpretation and considers
whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept
an uncertain tax treatment. The Company reflects the effect
of uncertainty for each uncertain tax treatment by using
one of two methods, the expected value method (the sum
of the probability - weighted amounts in a range of possible
outcomes) or the most likely amount (single most likely
amount method in a range of possible outcomes), depending
on which is expected to better predict the resolution of the
uncertainty. The Company applies consistent judgements
and estimates if an uncertain tax treatment affects both the
current and the deferred tax.

Borrowing costs

General and specific borrowing costs that are directly
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production
of a qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of
time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for
its intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are assets that
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready
for their intended use or sale.

Investment income earned on the temporary investment of
specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying
assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for
capitalisation.

All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in
which they are incurred.

2415 Provision and Contingencies

Provisions are recognised when the Company has a
present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past
events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be
required to settle the obligation and the amount can be
reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future
operating losses.

Provisions are measured at the present value of
management’s best estimate of the expenditure required
to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting
period. The discount rate used to determine the present
value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to
the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is
a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but
probably will not require an outflow of resources embodying
economic benefits or the amount of such obligation cannot
be measured reliably. When there is a possible obligation
or a present obligation in respect of which likelihood of
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is
remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

216 Employee benefits

268

a. Short-term obligations

Liabilities for wages and salaries, including other
monetary and non-monetary benefits that are
expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after
the end of the reporting period are recognised and
measured at the undiscounted amounts expected to
be paid when the liabilities are settled.

b. Post-employment obligations (Defined Benefit
Obligations)
The Company operates the following  post-
employment schemes:

. defined benefit plans - gratuity and post-
retirement medical benefit scheme

. defined contribution plans such as provident fund.

Defined Benefit Plans - Gratuity obligations and
post-retirement medical benefit obligations

The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet
in respect of gratuity is the present value of the
defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting
period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined
benefit obligation is calculated annually by actuaries
using the projected unit credit method.

The present value of the defined benefit obligation
is determined by discounting the estimated future
cash outflows by reference to market yields at the
end of the reporting period on government bonds
that have terms approximating to the terms of the
related obligation.

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the
discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit
obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is
included in employee benefit expense in the statement
of profit and loss. Remeasurement gains and losses
arising from experience adjustments and changes in
actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period
in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive
income. They are included in retained earnings in the
statement of changes in equity and in the balance
sheet. Changes in the present value of the defined
benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments
or curtailments are recognised immediately in the
statement of profit and loss as past service cost.

Compensated absences

The Company’s liabilities under for long term
compensated absences is determined on the basis of
actuarial valuation made at the end of each financial
year using the projected unit credit method except for
short term compensated absences which are provided
for based on estimates. The benefits are discounted
using the market yields at the end of the reporting
period that gave terms approximating to the terms of
the related obligation. Re-measurements as a result
of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial
assumptions are recognised in profit or Loss.

Defined contribution plans

Company pays provident fund contributions to publicly
administered provident funds and National Pension
Scheme (NPS) as per local regulations. Company’s
contribution to provident fund and NPS is recognised
on accrual basis in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Company has no further payment obligations once
the contributions have been paid.

c. Other long-term employee benefit obligations

The liabilities for long service awards and
compensated absences which are not expected to be
settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the
reporting period are measured at the present value
of expected future payments to be made in respect
of services provided by employees up to the end of
the reporting period, using the projected unit credit
method. Re-measurements as a result of experience
adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are
recognised in the statement of profit and Loss.

Segment reporting

The Board of Directors assesses performance of the
Company as Chief Operating Decision Maker.

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent
with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating
Decision Maker {CODM).

The Company has a single operating segment that is
“Sale of Natural Gas”. Accordingly, the segment revenue,
segment results, segment assets and segment liabilities
are reflected in the financial statements as at and for the
financial year ended March 31, 2025.

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the
profit after tax before other comprehensive income by the
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding
during the financial year. Diluted earnings per share is
computed by dividing the profit after tax by the weighted
average number of equity and dilutive equity equivalent
shares outstanding during the year, except where the
results would be anti-dilutive.

249 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of

estimation uncertainty

In the application of the Company's accounting policies,
which are described in note 2, the management of the
Company are required to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on
historical experience and other factors that are considered to
be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised
if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of
the revision and future periods if the revision affects both
current and future periods.

In the following areas the management of the Company has
made critical judgements and estimates

Useful lives of property, plant and equipment

The Company reviews the useful lives and carrying amount
of property, plant and equipment at the end of each
reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in
depreciation expense in future periods.

Provision for Capital Work in Progress

The Company has a defined policy for provision of slow
and non-moving capital work in progress (CWIP} based on
the ageing of CWIP. The Company reviews the policy at
regular intervals.

Estimation of defined benefit obligation

The cost of the defined benefit plan and other post-
employment benefits and the present value of such
obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An
actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions
that may differ from actual developments in the future.
These include the determination of the discount rate, future
salary increases, mortality rates and attrition rate. Due to
the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-
term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive
to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are
reviewed at each reporting date.

31. Disclosures under Indian Accounting Standards: (Contd..)

Demographic risk - This is the risk of variability of results due to unsystematic nature of decrements that include mortality,
withdrawal, disability and retirement. The effect of these decrements on the defined benefit obligation is not straight forward

and depends upon the combination of salary increase, medical cost inflation, discount rate and vesting criteria.

Salary risk - The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan

participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.

Asset Liability Matching (ALM) Risk: The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow. Since the plan is invested in

lines of Rule 101 of Income Tax Rules, 1962, this generally reduces ALM risk.

Mortality risk: Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for lifetime and payable till retirement age only, plan does not

These plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as:

Investment risk - The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by
reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bond yields; if the return on plan asset is below
this rate, it will create a plan deficit.

Interest rate risk - A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset
by an increase in the return on the plan’s debt investments. The expected rate of return on plan assets is determined after
considering several applicable factors such as the composition of the plan assets, investment strategy, market scenario, etc.

iii)

have any longevity risk.

Concentration Risk: Plan is having a concentration risk as all the assets are invested with the insurance company and a
default will wipe out all the assets. Although probability of this is very low as insurance companies have to follow stringent
regulatory guidelines which mitigate risk.

In order to protect the capital and optimise returns within acceptable risk parameters, the plan assets are well diversified.
The estimate of future salary increases considered, takes into account the inflation, seniority, promotion, increments and
other relevant factors.

Sensitivity

Sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:

Particulars Change in As at March 31, 2025 As at March 31, 2024

Assumption Increase by Decrease by Increase by Decrease by
& Crore ¥ Crore % Crore = Crore

Discount rate +/-1% 5.24 {6.32) 3.98 (4.76)
Expected rate of escalation in salary +/-1% {4.83) 4.20 (3.24) 2.84
Attrition rate +/-1% {0.43) 0.48 {0.49) 0.56

Positive figures represent decrease in obligation and negative figures represents increase obligation.

The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation
as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions
may be correlated.

Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been
calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in
calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.

There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior years.

Other Long-term Employee Benefits

Compensated absences which are accumulated and not expected to be availed within twelve months after the end of the
reporting period in which the employee renders the related service are recognised as a liability at the present value of the
defined benefit obligation as at the balance sheet date. Long Service Awards are recognised as a liability based on actuarial
valuation of the defined benefit obligation as at the balance sheet date.

Fair Value Hierarchy of Financial Assets and Liabilities

This section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments that are
(i) recognised and measured at fair value and (ii) measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are disclosed in the
financial statements. To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, Company has
classified its financial instruments into three levels prescribed under the accounting standards below:

Level 1: inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company can access
at the measurement date.

Level 2: inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly or indirectly.

Level 3: inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Company's policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers
out of fair value hierarchy levels as at the end of the reporting period. There is no Level 1 and Level 3 type Financial Assets
or Financials Liabilities as on March 31, 2025.

(i) | Measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)

The Company has investments in debt mutual funds which are not quoted in the active market. These debt mutual
funds are subsequently measured at FVTPL as per the closing NAV statement provided by the mutual fund house.
The corresponding unrealized gain or loss on fair valuation is recorded in profit and loss account under other income.
Accordingly, such debt mutual funds fall under fair value hierarchy level 2. The fair value of these mutual funds as at
March 31, 2025 is $1,054.23 crore (previous year 968.38 crore}.

(ii) Measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI):

The Company has investments in Compulsorily Convertible Preference Shares (CCPS) which are not quoted in the
active market. These CCPS are subsequently measured at FVOCI on the basis of fair valuation on the reporting date.
The corresponding unrealized gain or loss on fair valuation is recorded in OCI. The fair value of these CCPS as at March
31, 2025 is ENil (previous year 750.00).

(iii) Measured at Amortised Cost for which Fair Value is disclosed

The fair values of all current financial assets and liabilities including trade receivables and unbilled revenue, cash and cash
equivalents, bank balances, bank fixed deposits, corporate fixed deposits, security deposits, trade payables, lease liabilities,
payables for purchase of property, plant and equipment and other current financial assets and liabilities are considered
to be the same as their carrying values, due to their short term nature. The fair values of all non-current financial assets
and liabilities including security deposits, trade receivables and Lease liabilities and other non-current financial assets and
liabilities are considered to be the same as their carrying values, as the impact of fair valuation is not material.

Capital Management

Total equity as shown in the balance sheet includes equity share capital, general reserves and retained earnings. There are
no interest bearing Loans and borrowings by the Company.

The Company aims to manage its capital efficiently to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to optimise
returns to its shareholders.

The Company's policy is to maintain a stable and strong capital structure with a focus on total equity to maintain investor's,
creditor’s and market confidence and to sustain future development and growth of its business. The Company will take
appropriate steps in order to maintain, or if necessary adjust, its capital structure. The management monitors the return on
capital as well as the level of dividends to shareholders.

Financial risk management

Company’s activities expose it to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. This note explains the sources of risk which the
company is exposed to and how the company manages the risk and its impact on the financial statements.

() Credit Risk

Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to
the Company. The credit risk arises from trade receivables, security deposits, cash and cash equivalents and deposits
with banks and corporates.

Trade receivables

The Company supplies natural gas to customers.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited as majority credit sales are made to high
credit worthy entities and balance credit sales are against securities in the form of customer security deposits, bank

guarantees and letter of credit. All trade receivables are reviewed and assessed for default on regular basis. Our
historical experience of collecting receivables, supported by the level of default, is that credit risk is low.

For trade receivables, except for specifically identified cases, Company follows a simplified approach where provision
is made as per the ageing buckets which are designed based on historical facts and patterns.

Reconciliation of expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables

Loss allowance at the beginning of the year 3.32 3.52

Loss allowance at the end of the year 3.31 3.32

Other financial assets

The Company maintains exposure in security deposits, reinstatement charges receivable, cash and cash equivalents
and term deposits with banks and corporates.

In case of security deposits and reinstatement charges, majority of which are given to Municipal authorities (which
are government controlled entities) towards pipeline laying activity, the credit risk is low. However, historically the
company has experienced a delay/ non receipt of these amounts and hence allowances have been taken into account
for the expected credit losses of these security deposits and reinstatement charges.

In case of bank /corporate fixed deposits regular quotations for interest rate are invited and based on best offered
tate the bank deposits are placed with banks/corporates having reasonably high net worth. Exposures of deposit
placed are restricted to limits per bank/corporate as per policy and limits are actively monitored by the Company. We
understand that the credit risk is very low to moderate for such deposits.

The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of each class of financial assets as disclosed in
note 4,5,6,9,10,11 and 12.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will find it difficult in meeting its obligations associated with its financial
liabilities on time.

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability
of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due and to close out
market positions. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Company’s treasury maintains flexibility in
funding by maintaining availability under cash and cash equivalents, bank fixed deposits, corporate fixed deposits
and mutual funds.

Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Company’s liquidity position and cash and cash equivalents on the basis
of expected cash flows.

The tables below analyses the Company's financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on their

On January 09, 2025, The Joint Commissioner CGST and Central Excise Mumbai East Commissionerate, has passed an
order (received by the Company on January 18, 2025) demanding GST liability under Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM)
towards road re-instatement (“Rasta Nuksan Bharpai”} charges paid to the Local Authorities by the Company while laying
underground pipelines, amounting to 754.33 Crore plus applicable penalty and interest under Section 74 (1) of CGST Act, 2017.

The Company had filed an appeal with First Appellate, Commissioner Appeal against the said order and the decision from
the hearing held on April 30, 2025, is currently pending. Based on the legal opinion obtained, the Company believes that it
has a strong case and does not expect any outflow of economic resources.

Central/State/Local Authority property taxes, lease rents, pipeline related re-instatement charges etc. claims disputed by the
Company relating to issues of applicability and determination aggregating to %3.80 crore (previous year 4.37 crore).

GAIL (India) Limited (GAIL) raised demand in April 2014 for transportation tariff with respect to ONGC’s Uran Trombay Natural
Gas Pipeline (UTNGPL) pursuant to demand on them by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC), based on the
Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB} order dated December 30, 2013, determining tariff for ONGC’s
UTNGPL as a common carrier. The total demand raised by GAIL for the period from November 2008 till July 2021 was
331.80 Crore. The Company disputed the demand with GAIL based on contractual provisions and since the transportation
charges are to be paid by a third-party user for utilisation of UTNGPL to ONGC as common carrier and not for transportation
of its own gas by ONGC.

The Company filed an appeal with the PNGRB in February 2015, the same was dismissed in October 2015. The Company
filed a writ petition, in November 2015, with the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi. The Court advised the Company to file an
appeal with Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL} being Appellate Authority of the PNGRB in November 2016. The matter
was heard by APTEL and remanded back to the PNGRB on technical grounds in September 2019. PNGRB in March 2020,
had passed an Order which directed the Company and GAIL to pay the disputed transportation tariff to ONGC. The Company
filed an Appeal before APTEL against the PNGRB order in April 2020. The matter was heard by APTEL in October 2020.
APTEL remanded back the case in July 2021 to PNGRB for proper adjudication. The matter was heard by PNGRB in April
2022 and an order was passed in September 2022 directing the Company to pay the disputed transportation tariff for the
period 2014 to 2021 as per the transportation tariff fixed by PNGRB for UTNGPL. The Company had filed a writ before the
Hon’ble High Court of Delhi challenging the PNGRB’s September 2022 order. The Hon'ble High Court of Delhi vide its order
dated December 13, 2022 has stayed the recovery against the PNGRB order and has directed the Company to deposit a
sum of 750 Crore with GAIL by February 15, 2023, which was deposited with GAIL on February 14, 2023. The Hon’ble High
Court has rescheduled the next hearing to July 10, 2025.

Based on the legal opinions obtained, the Company believes that it has a strong case and does not expect any outflow of
resources. Hence, no provision has been recognised.

Claims from consumers are not acknowledged as debts 0.47 crore (previous year 70.49 crore).

Negotiation with respect to the revision of trade margin with the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) is pending from April 2019
to March 2023 for Mumbai Metro region and provision towards liability has been considered appropriately by the Company,
pending final settlement.

policies, and note 3 for details and movement in capital

As at March 31, 2025, the Parent Company has ¥ 97415
crore of Capital Work-in-Progress. The Parent Company’s
spending on Capital Work-in-progress is material as

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements
in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SA’s) specified
under section 143 (10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those
Standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibility
for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of
our report. We are independent of the Group and its associates
in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”} together with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated
financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the
Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the
ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained
by us and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in
terms of their reports referred to in the sub-paragraphs (a) and {(b)
of the Other Matters section below, is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated
financial statements.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the
consolidated financial statements of the current period. These
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the
consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on
these matters. We have determined the matters described below
to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

Auditor's Response

Our audit procedures among others included the following:

We assessed the design and implementation and tested the
operating effectiveness of key financial controls over the
management review of capital work-in-progress.

capitalisation along with the reasons of the delay and the
expected capitalization dates from the management.

indicated by the total value as at date. The assessment and
the timing of recognition of asset, as to whether the asset is
in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable
of operating in the manner intended by management as set
out in Ind AS 16, ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’, requires
judgement and is dependent on the completion of projects
after obtaining all necessary approvals.

The Parent Company has Slow moving / non-moving
projects lying in capital work-in- progress amounting
to %92.50 crore where there is significant delay in
capitalisation because of several external factors. As
a result, this is considered as a key audit matter, with
focus on certain slow moving/non-moving projects, where
the risk of assessment of impairment of such items was
deemed higher because of the complexity of the specific
projects and the delays involved.

Auditor's Response

« For assets capitalized during the year, we considered the
planned vs actual capitalization dates to test the management’s
assessment of expected capitalization dates.

« We tested management’s assessment of indicators of
impairment of old projects and the estimated allowance created
and write offs made in the current year basis the policy on slow
moving and non-moving projects as approved by the Board.

« We have tested the appropriateness of categorizing the
projects as slow and non-moving basis the expected period of
completion as determined by the Company.

« For old projects capitalized during the year, we tested on
sample basis to determine that the useful life of the asset was
adjusted to reflect the wear and tear of such assets.

e We evaluated the disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements.

Accounting for Acquisition / Business combination

{As described in note 30.12 of the consolidated financial
statements containing details of Business Combinations)

During the previous year, the Parent Company acquired 100%
stake in Unison Enviro Private Limited (UEPL} from its erstwhile
shareholders for a consideration of 7 562.09 crore.

The Parent Company accounted for the business
combination under the acquisition method of accounting
for business combinations.

Goodwill had been determined on provisional basis as
a difference between the purchase consideration and
fair value of net assets acquired (net of tax impact} in the
previous year.

The Parent Company finalised the purchase price
allocation in the current year and accordingly, the
purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities (including contingent liabilities, if any) assumed
based on their fair values on the acquisition dates.

We considered the audit of accounting for this acquisition to

be a key audit matter as these are significant transactions

during the year which require significant management
judgement regarding:

e Allocation of the purchase price to the assets and
liabilities acquired and adjustments made to align
accounting policies of the newly acquired entity
with the Group.

e Fair valuation of the assets and liabilities acquired and
to identify intangible assets acquired in the acquisition.

e Accounting and disclosures given in the financial
statements in accordance with the applicable Ind AS.

Principal audit procedures included the following:

« We have, amongst others, read the Shareholders agreement,
and other related documents to obtain an understanding of the
transactions and the key terms and conditions.

« We have evaluated the control assessment made by the
management and assessing whether the appropriate
accounting treatment has been applied to these transactions.

« We have assessed the competence, capabilities and objectivity
of the valuation expert engaged by the Parent Company.

« We have gained an understanding of the work of the expert
by verifying the valuation report on the purchase price
allocation and understanding valuation methodologies used
by management and the external valuation experts in the fair
valuation of acquired assets and liabilities.

@ We have involved our valuation specialists to assess the
appropriateness of the methodology applied and key
assumptions used in determining the fair value of identifiable
assets and liabilities.

« We have verified the accounting treatment adopted in respect
of the acquisition date accounting.

«@ We have verified the adequacy of the disclosures in
respect of the consolidation in accordance with Ind AS 103
Business Combinations.

e We read the valuation reports for the purchase price
considerations paid for these acquisition. We tested the
identification and fair valuation of the acquired assets including
intangible assets acquired and liabilities by corroborating this
identification based on our discussion with management and
understanding of the business.

Information Other than the Financial Statements and
Auditor’s Report Thereon

e The Parent Company’s Board of Directors is responsible
for the other information. The other information comprises
the information included in the Directors’ Report, Business
Responsibility Report, Management Discussion and
Analysis and Corporate Governance Report, but does not
include the consolidated financial statements, standalone
financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.

e Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does
not cover the other information and we do not express any
form of assurance conclusion thereon.

. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information,
compare with the financial statements of the subsidiaries
audited by the other auditors, to the extent it relates to these
entities and, in doing so, place reliance on the work of the
other auditors and consider whether the other information
is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial
statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of
our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
Other information so far as it relates to subsidiaries, is traced
from their financial statements audited by the other auditors.

e If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that
there is a material misstatement of this other information,
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to
report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management and Board of
Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Parent Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for
the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements
that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial
position, consolidated financial performance including other
comprehensive loss, consolidated cash flows and consolidated
changes in equity of the Group including its Associates in
accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted
in India, including Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in
the Group and of its associates are responsible for maintenance
of adequate accounting records in accordance with the
provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group
and its associates for preventing and detecting frauds and other
irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting
policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance

of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation
of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of
the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the
Parent, as aforesaid.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective
Management and Board of Directors of the companies included
in the Group and of its associates are responsible for assessing
the ability of the respective entities to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless
the respective Board of Directors either intend to liquidate their
respective entities or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so.

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included
in the Group and of its associates are also responsible for
overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group and of
its associates.

Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the
Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that
an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism
throughout the audit. We also:

. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

e Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls relevant
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3\i) of
the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on
whether the Parent Company has adequate internal financial
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in
place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
related disclosures made by the management.

. Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of
the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant
doubt on the ability of the Group and its associates to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group
and its associates to cease to continue as a going concern.

. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content
of the consolidated financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial
statements represent the underlying transactions and
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the
financial information of the entities or business activities
within the Group and its associates to express an opinion on
the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible
for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit
of the financial statements of entities or business activities
included in the consolidated financial statements of which
we are the independent auditors. For the other entities or
business activities included in the consolidated financial
statements, which have been audited by other auditors,
such other auditors remain responsible for the direction,
supervision and performance of the audits carried out by
them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated
financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes
it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably
knowledgeable user of the consolidated financial statements
may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and
qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work

310

and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate
the effect of any identified misstatements in the consolidated
financial statements.

We communicate with those charged with governance of
the Parent Company and such other entities included in
the consolidated financial statements of which we are the
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal financial
controls that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements
regarding independence, and to communicate with them
all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable,
related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with
governance, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.
We describe these matters in our auditors report unless law or
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure “A” to the Independent Auditor’s Report

(Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date)

Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference
to consolidated financial statements under Clause (i)
of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act,
2013 (the “Act”)

In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial
statements of the Company as at and for the year ended March
31, 2025, we have audited the internal financial controls with
teference to consolidated financial statements of Mahanagar
Gas Limited (hereinafter referred to as “Parent Company”) and
its subsidiary companies and its associate companies which are
companies incorporated in India, as of that date.

Management’s and Board of Director’s Responsibilities
for Internal Financial Controls

The respective Company’s management and Board of Directors of
the Parent, its subsidiary companies and its associate companies,
which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible
for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls
with reference to consolidated financial statements based on
the internal control with reference to consolidated financial
statements criteria established by the respective Companies
considering the essential components of internal control stated
in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India (ICAI}. These responsibilities include the
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal
financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the
orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence
to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its
assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the
timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required
under the Companies Act, 2013.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of
the Parent Company, its subsidiary companies and its associate
companies, which are companies incorporated in India, based
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over
Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute
of Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards on Auditing,
prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to
the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls
with reference to consolidated financial statements. Those

314

Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with
ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements
was established and maintained and if such controls operated
effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls
with reference to consolidated financial statements and their
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls
with reference to consolidated financial statements included
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with
reference to consolidated financial statements, assessing the
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the
auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due
to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the
audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the subsidiary
companies, which are companies incorporated in India, in terms of
their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion
on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated
financial statements of the Parent Company and its subsidiary
companies which are companies incorporated in India.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference
to consolidated financial statements

A company's internal financial control with reference to
consolidated financial statements is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with
reference to consolidated financial statements includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorisations of management and
directors of the company; and (3} provide reasonable assurance

regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls
with reference to consolidated financial statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls
with reference to consolidated financial statements, including
the possibility of collusion or improper management override
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may
occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation
of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk
that the internal financial control with reference to consolidated
financial statements may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion

In our opinion to the best of our information and according to
the explanations given to us and based on the consideration of
the reports of the other auditors referred to in the Other Matters
paragraph below, the Parent Company and its subsidiary
companies which are companies incorporated in India, have,
in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls
with reference to consolidated financial statements and such
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated
financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31,

2025, based on the criteria for internal financial control with
reference to consolidated financial statements established by
the respective companies considering the essential components
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of
Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

Other Matter

adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements

incorporated in India, is based solely on the corresponding
reports of the auditors of such company incorporated in India.

Companies (Indian Accounting Standards} Rules, 2015
(as amended from time to time) and presentation and
disclosure requirement of Division Il of Schedule Ill of
the Companies Act 2013, (Ind AS Compliant Schedule
{I}, as applicable to financial statements.

Accordingly, the Company has prepared these
Financial Statements which comprise the Consolidated
Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, the Consolidated
Statement of Profit and Loss, the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows and the Consolidated

Statement of Changes in Equity for the year ended
March 31, 2025, and material accounting policies and
other explanatory information (together hereinafter
referred to as “consolidated financial statements”)

Historical cost convention

The Consolidated Financial statements have been
prepared on a historical cost convention and on
an accrual basis, except for certain items that are
measured at fair value at the end of each reporting
period as required by relevant Ind AS:

. Financial assets and financial liabilities
measured at fair value (Refer accounting policy
on financial Instruments}.

. Defined benefit and other long-term
employee benefits.

Current vs Non-Current Classification:

The group presents assets and Liabilities in the balance
sheet based on current/ non-current classification.

An asset is treated as current when it satisfies any of
the following criteria:

e it is expected to be realized in, or is intended
for sale or consumption in, the Group’s normal
operating cycle,

e it is held primarily for the purpose of trading,

e it is expected to be realised within 12 months
after the reporting date, or

e it is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted
from being exchanged or used to settle a liability
for at least 12 months after the reporting date.

All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is treated as current when it satisfies any of
the following criteria:

e it is expected to be settled in the Group’s normal
operating cycle,

e It is held primarily for the purpose of trading,

. It is due to be settled within twelve months after
the reporting period, or

322

e@ the Group does not have an unconditional right
to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12
months after the reporting date.

All other liabilities are classified as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified
as non-current.

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition
of assets for processing and their realisation in cash
and cash equivalents.

Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity
with Ind AS requires the management to make estimates,
judgements and assumptions. These estimates,
judgments and assumptions affect the application of
accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the period. The application of accounting policies that
require critical accounting estimates involving complex
and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions
in these financial statements have been disclosed
in Note no. 219. Accounting estimates could change
from period to period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. Appropriate changes in estimates are
made as management becomes aware of changes in
circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes in
estimates are reflected in the financial statements in the
period in which changes are made and, if material, their
effects are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements.

Business Combinations

Business combinations are accounted for using
the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition
is measured as the aggregate of the consideration
transferred measured at fair value on acquisition
date. The amount of any non-controlling interests
in the acquiree for each business combination,
the Company elects whether to measure the non-
controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at
the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable
net assets. Acquisition-related costs as and when
incurred are expensed.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets
acquired, and the liabilities assumed are recognised at
their fair values on acquisition date. For this purpose,
the liabilities assumed include contingent Liabilities
representing present obligation and they are measured
at fair values on acquisition date irrespective of the
fact that outflow of resources embodying economic
benefits is not probable. However, the following assets
and liabilities acquired in a business combination are
measured at the basis indicated below:

. Deferred tax assets or liabilities and potential
tax effects of temporary differences and
carry forwards of an acquiree that exist at
the acquisition date or arise because of the
acquisition are accounted in accordance with Ind
AS 12-Income Tax.

e The assets or liabilities related to employee
benefit arrangements are recognised
and measured in accordance with Ind AS
19-Employee Benefits.

. Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as
held for sale and Non-current Assets Held for
Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured
in accordance with Ind AS 105-Non-current Assets
Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.

Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the
financial statements of MGL and its subsidiaries as at
March 31, 2025. Control is achieved when the Group
is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its
involvement with the investee and has the ability
to affect those returns through its power over the
investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee
if and only if the Group has:

Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give
it the current ability to direct the relevant activities
of the investee)

Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its
involvement with the investee, and

The ability to use its power over the investee to
affect its returns.

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority
of voting rights result in control. To support this
presumption and when the Group has less than
a majority of the voting or similar rights of an
investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and
circumstances in assessing whether it has power over
an investee, including:

. The contractual arrangement with the other vote
holders of the investee

. Rights arising fromothercontractualarrangements
. The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights

. The size of the group’s holding of voting rights
relative to the size and dispersion of the holdings
of the other voting rights holders.

The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an
investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there
are changes to one or more of the elements of control.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group
obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when
the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets,
liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary
acquired or disposed of during the year are included
in the consolidated financial statements from the
date the Group gains control until the date the Group
ceases to control the subsidiary.

The financial statements of the Group and its
subsidiaries have been consolidated using uniform
accounting policies for like transactions and other
events in similar circumstances. If necessary,
adjustments are made to the financial statements
of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into
line with the Group’s accounting policies if material to
the group financials. The financial statements of the
subsidiary companies used in the consolidation are
drawn up to the same reporting date as that of the
parent i.e. year ended March 31, 2025.

Consolidation Procedure

a) The consolidated financial statements of the
Company and its subsidiaries are combined on
a line-by-line basis by adding together the book
values of like items of assets, liabilities, income
and expenses after fully eliminating intra-Group

Corporate Statutory Financial
Overview Reports Statements
al al Sel

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for the year ended March 31, 2025

balances and intra-Group transactions resulting
in unrealized profits or losses.

b) Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the
parent’s investment in each subsidiary and the
parent’s portion of equity of each subsidiary.

c) Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities,
income, expenses and cash flows relating to
transactions between entities of the group (profits
or losses resulting from intragroup transactions
that are recognised in assets, such as inventory
and fixed assets, are eliminated in full).
Intragroup losses may indicate an impairment
that requires recognition in the consolidated
financial statements. Ind AS 12 Income Taxes
applies to temporary differences that arise from
the elimination of profits and losses resulting
from intragroup transactions.

d) Profit or loss and each component of other
comprehensive income (OCl} are attributed to
the equity holders of the parent of the Group
and to the non-controlling interests, even if this
results in the non- controlling interests having a
deficit balance.

h. Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new
standards or amendments to the existing standards
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules
as issued from time to time. For the year ended March
31, 2025, MCA has notified Ind AS — 117 Insurance
Contracts and amendments to Ind AS 116 - Leases,
relating to sale and leaseback transactions, applicable
to the Company w.e-f. April 1, 2024. The Group has
reviewed the new pronouncements and based on its
evaluation has determined that it does not have any
significant impact in its financial statements.

2.2 Property, plant and equipment

An item of property, plant and equipment (PPE) that
qualifies as an asset is measured on initial recognition at
cost. Following initial recognition, all items of property,
plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to
the acquisition or construction of the items. Subsequent
costs are added to existing item’s carrying amount or
recognised as a separate item, as appropriate, only when

323

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for the year ended March 31, 2025

324

it is probable that future economic benefits associated with
the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can
be measured reliably. All other subsequent costs related
to an item are charged to the statement of profit and loss
during the reporting period in which they are incurred.
In case of commissioned assets where final payment
to the contractors is pending, capitalisation is made on
provisional basis subject to necessary adjustment in cost
and depreciation in the year of settlement.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are
expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any
gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item
of property, plant and equipment is determined as the
difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying
amount of the asset and is recognized in Statement of
Profit and Loss.

a. Commissioning

Gas distribution systems are treated as commissioned
when supply of gas reaches to the individual points
and ready for intended use.

b. Capital work-in-progress (CWIP)

Capital Work-in-Progress includes, material, labour
and other directly attributable costs incurred on
assets, which are yet to be commissioned. Capital
Inventory is included in Capital work-in-progress and
comprises stock of capital items and construction
materials at stores and with contractors.

The Group has provisioning policy for slow and non-
moving CWIP (Refer note 2.19).

c Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and
residual value

Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
method to allocate cost of the asset, net of estimated
residual value, over their estimated useful lives. The
useful lives and residual values are as prescribed
under schedule Il to Companies Act, 2013, except
in respect of, following category of property plant
and equipment where useful life estimated as
per management estimate is based on technical
advice, taking into account the nature of the asset,

teplacements generally required from the point of
view of operational effectiveness:

Type of assets Useful lives
CNG Compressors and Dispensers 10 Years
CNG Cascades 20 Years
Underground pipeline network 25 Years
Intangible assets (Softwares/Licenses) 6 Years
Furniture provided for the use of 6 Years
employees
Electrical Equipment provided for the 4 Years

use of employees

The residual values and useful lives of the assets are
reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of
each reporting period.

Depreciation on the property, plant and equipment
added / disposed off / discarded during the year is
provided on pro-rata basis with reference to the time
of addition/disposal/discarding.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by
comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These
are included in the statement of profit and loss under
Other Expenses.

d. On transition to Ind AS, the Group has elected to
continue with the carrying value of all its property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets recognised
as at April 01, 2015 measured as per previous GAAP
and use that carrying value as deemed cost of
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

2.24 Goodwill and Other Intangible assets

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is
initially measured at cost, being the excess of the
consideration transferred over the net identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities assumed, in accordance
with Ind AS 103

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured
on initial recognition at cost. Intangible assets arising
on acquisition of business are measured at fair value
as at date of acquisition.

2.3 Impairment of assets

The carrying values of assets/cash generating units at
each balance sheet date are reviewed for impairment. The

Corporate Statutory Financial
Overview Reports Statements
al al Sel

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for the year ended March 31, 2025

2.4

cash generating unit is the group of assets that generates
identified independent Cash Flows. If any indication of
impairment exists, the recoverable amount of such assets
is estimated and impairment is recognised, if the carrying
amount of these assets exceeds their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value
less costs of disposal and their value in use. Value in use
is arrived at by discounting the future cash flows to their
present value based on an appropriate discount factor.
When there is indication that an impairment loss recognised
for an asset in earlier accounting periods no longer exists
or may have decreased, such reversal of impairment loss is
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In
determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market
transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions
can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.

Leases

The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract
is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the
right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of
time in exchange for consideration.

The Group as a lessee

The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases
for land and buildings, Motor Vehicles, Plant and Equipment
and Computers. The Group assesses whether a contract
contains a lease, at inception of a contract. To assess
whether a contract conveys the right to control the use
of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: (i) the
contract involves the use of an identified asset {ii) the Group
has substantially all the economic benefits from use of the
asset throughout the period of the lease and {iii) the Group
has the right to direct the use of the asset.

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Group
recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding
lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a
lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or
less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these
short-term and low value leases, the Group recognizes the
lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line
basis over the term of the lease.

2.5

Certain lease arrangements include the options to extend or
terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU
assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is
reasonably certain that they will be exercised.

The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which
comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for
any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement
date of the lease. They are subsequently measured at cost
less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement
date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease
term and useful life of the underlying asset. Right of use
assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying
amounts may not be recoverable.

For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable
amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell
and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset
basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that
are largely independent of those from other assets. In such
cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash
Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost
at the present value of the future lease payments. The
lease payments are discounted using the interest rate
implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using
the incremental borrowing rates. Lease liabilities are
remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related
right of use asset if the Group changes its assessment if
whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.

Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately
presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have
been classified as financing cash flows.
Investments and other financial assets
a. Classification

The group classifies its financial assets in the following

measurement categories:

e those to be measured subsequently at fair value
(either through other comprehensive income, or
through profit or loss}, and

« those measured at amortised cost.

325

MAHANAGAR
GAS

Mahanagar Gas Limited
Annual Report 2024-25

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for the year ended March 31, 2025

326

The classification depends on the Group’s business
model for managing the financial assets and the
contractual terms of the cash flows.

For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses
will either be recorded in profit or loss or other
comprehensive income. For investments in debt
instruments, this will depend on the business model in
which the investment is held.

The Group reclassifies debt investments when and
only when its business model for managing those
assets changes.

Assets that are held for collection of contractual
cash flows where those cash flows represent sole
payment of principal and interest are measured at
amortised cost.

Investments in mutual funds are primarily held for
the Group's cash requirements and can be readily
convertible in cash. These investments are initially
recognised at fair value and carried at fair value
through profit or loss (FVTPL).

A financial asset is classified as FVTOCI only ff it
meets both the of the following conditions and is not
recognized at FVTPL.

. The asset is held within a business model
whose objective is achieved by both
collecting contractual cash flows and selling
financial assets; and

. The contractual terms of the financial asset give
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the
principal amount outstanding.

Financial Asset included within the FVTOCI category
dre measured initially as well as at each reporting date
at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in
the other comprehensive income (OCI}. However, the
Group recognizes interest income, impairment losses
& reversals in the Statement of Profit and Loss, if any
On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss
previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from the
equity to Statement of Profit and Loss.

Initial recognition and measurement

All financial assets are recognised initially at fair
value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable
to the acquisition or issue of financial asset (other
than financial asset at fair value through Profit or
Loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value
of the financial assets, as appropriate on_ initial
recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to
the acquisition of financial assets at fair value through
the Statement of Profit and Loss are recognised
immediately in Statement of Profit and Loss.

Subsequent measurement

All recognised financial assets are subsequently
measured in their entirety at either amortized cost or
‘fair value through profit or loss’ or ‘fair value through
other comprehensive income’, depending on the
classification of the financial asset.

Impairment of financial assets

The group assesses on a forward looking basis the
expected credit losses (ECL) associated with its assets
carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology
applied depends on whether there has been a
significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables,
except for specifically identified cases, the Group
follows a simplified approach where provision is made
as per the ageing buckets which are designed based
on historical facts and patterns. For refundable security
deposits and reinstatement charges recoverable
with government authorities, the Group recognises
impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at
each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.
Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting
from all possible default events over the expected life
of a financial instrument. ECL is the difference between
all contractual cash flows that are due to the Group in
accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that
the Group expects to receive {i.e., all cash shortfalls),
discounted at the original Effective Interest Rate (EIR).

ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal)
recognized during the period is recognized as income/
expense in the statement of profit and loss (P&L). This
amount is reflected under the head ‘other expenses’
in the P&L. The balance sheet presentation for various
financial instruments is described below:

Financial assets measured as at amortised cost: ECL is
presented as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part of
the measurement of those assets in the balance sheet.
The allowance reduces the net carrying amount. Until
the asset meets write-off criteria, the Group does
not reduce impairment allowance from the gross
carrying amount.

For assessing increase in credit risk and impairment
loss, the Group combines financial instruments on
the basis of shared credit risk characteristics with the
objective of facilitating an analysis that is designed
to enable significant increases in credit risk to be
identified on a timely basis.

De-recognition of financial assets

A financial asset is de-recognised only when

° The Group has transferred the rights to receive
cash flows from the financial asset or

° retains the contractual rights to receive the
cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a
contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to
one or more recipients.

Where the Group has transferred an asset, the Group
evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all
risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset.
In such cases, the financial asset is de-recognised.
Where the Group has not transferred substantially all
risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset,
the financial asset is not de-recognised.

Where the Group has neither transferred a financial
asset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of
ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is de-
recognised if the Group has not retained control of the
financial asset. Where the Group retains control of the
financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognised to
the extent of continuing involvement in the financial asset.

2.54 Cash and cash equivalents

For the purpose of presentation in the statement of
cash flows, Cash and cash equivalents includes cash
on hand, cash in transit and short-term deposits with
original maturities of three months or less that are
readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which
are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

2.6 Financial Liabilities

a

Classification as debt or equity

Debt and equity instruments issued by Group are
classified as either financial liabilities or as equity
in accordance with the substance of the contractual
arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability
and an equity instrument.

Measurement

Financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value
and are subsequently measured at amortised cost
using effective interest method or at FVTPL.

Financial liabilities subsequently measured at
amortised cost.

Financial liabilities that are not held-for-trading and
are not designated as at FVTPL are measured at
amortised cost at the end of subsequent accounting
periods. The carrying amounts of financial liabilities
that are subsequently measured at amortised cost are
determined based on the effective interest method.
Interest expense that is not capitalised as part of costs
of an asset is included in the ‘Finance Cost' line item.

The effective interest method is a method of
calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability
and of allocating interest expense over the relevant
period. The effective interest rate is the rate that
exactly discounts estimated future cash payments
{including all fees and points paid or received that
form an integral part of the effective interest rate,
transaction costs and other premiums or discounts)
through the expected life of the financial liability, or
{where appropriate} a shorter period, to the gross
carrying amount on initial recognition.

De-recognition of financial liabilities

The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and
only when, the Group's obligations are discharged,
cancelled or have expired. An exchange between with
a lender of debt instruments with substantially different
terms is accounted for as an extinguishment of the
original financial liability and the recognition of a new
financial liability. Similarly, a substantial modification
of the terms of an existing financial liability (whether or
not attributable to the financial difficulty of the debtor}
is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original

327

MAHANAGAR
GAS

Mahanagar Gas Limited
Annual Report 2024-25

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for the year ended March 31, 2025

27

328

financial liability and the recognition of a new financial
liability. The difference between the carrying amount of
the financial liability de-recognised and the consideration
paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss.

e. Trade and other payables

These amounts represent liabilities for goods and
services received by the Group prior to the end of
reporting period which are unpaid. Trade and other
payables are presented as current liabilities unless
payment is not due within 12 months after the reporting
period. They are recognised initially at their fair value
and subsequently measured at amortised cost.

Fair Value Measurements

The group measures financial instruments such as
derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability
takes place either:

(a) In the principal market for the asset or liability, or

(b) In the absence of a principal market, in the most
advantageous market for the asset or liability.

The principal or the most advantageous market must be
accessible by the Group.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using
the assumptions that market participants would use
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market
participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into
account a market participant's ability to generate economic
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by
selling it to another market participant that would use the
asset in its highest and best use.

The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate
in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are
available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of
relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of
unobservable inputs.

2.38

29

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured
or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based
on the Lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement as a whole:

° Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
markets for identical assets or Liabilities that the Group
can access at the measurement date;

° Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices
included within level 1 that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and

° Level 3- Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the
asset or liability.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial
statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines
whether transfer have occurred between levels in the
hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement as a whole} at the end of each reporting period.

Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in
this financial information is determined on such a basis,
except for share-based payment transactions that are
within the scope of Ind AS 102, leasing transactions that are
within the scope of Ind AS 17, and measurements that have
some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as
net realisable value in Ind AS 2 or value in use in Ind AS 36.

Offsetting financial instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net
amount is reported in the balance sheet where there is a
legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts
and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Inventories

Stock of Natural Gas and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is
valued at lower of cost computed on First In First Out (FIFO)
basis and estimated net realisable value.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in
the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs
of completion and the estimated costs necessary
to make the sale.

Corporate Statutory Financial
Overview Reports Statements

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

210

2.11

Inventories other than stock of gas are valued at cost,
which is determined on weighted average net off provision
for cost of obsolescence / slow moving inventory and other
anticipated losses, wherever considered necessary.

Cost ofinventories includes all other costs incurred in bringing
the inventories to their present location and condition.

Revenue from contracts with customers

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised
when control of the goods or services are transferred to
the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for
those goods or services.

The disclosures of significant accounting judgements,
estimates and assumptions relating to revenue from
contracts with customers are provided in Note 2.19

The group earns revenues primarily from sale of natural gas.
Revenue is recognised on supply of gas to customers by
metered/assessed measurements. The group has concluded
that it is the principal in allits revenue arrangements since it
is the primary obligor in all the revenue arrangements as it
has the pricing latitude and is also exposed to credit risk.

However, sales tax/ value added tax (VAT} / Goods and
Service Tax (GST) are not received by the Group on its
own account. Rather, it is tax collected on value added to
the commodity by the seller on behalf of the government.
Accordingly, it is excluded from revenue.

Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is
measured at the amount of transaction price (net of variable
consideration) allocated to that performance obligation. The
transaction price of goods sold and service rendered is net
of variable consideration on account of trade allowances,
rebates, value added tax, goods and service tax (GST) and
inclusive of excise duty.

Compensation receivable from customers with respect
to shortfall in minimum guaranteed Off take of gas is
recognised on contractual basis. Delayed payment
charges are recognised on receipt basis in view of
uncertainty of collection.

Interest and Dividend income

Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when
it is probable that the economic benefit will flow to the

2412

2.13

Group and the amount of income can be measured reliably.
Interest income is accrued on time basis, by reference
to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest
rate applicable.

Dividend income from investments is recognised when the
right to receive dividend has been established.

Foreign currencies

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the
functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates
of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses
resulting from the settlement of such transactions and
from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange
rates are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. At the
end of each reporting period, monetary assets and Liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the
functional currency spot rates prevailing at the reporting date.

Foreign exchange differences regarded as an adjustment to
borrowing costs are presented in the statement of profit and
loss, within finance costs. All other foreign exchange gains
and losses are presented in the statement of profit and loss
on a net basis within other gains/(losses}.

Income tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for
the year. Taxable profit differs from "profit before tax" as
reported in the statement of profit and loss because of
items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in
other years and items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Group's current tax is calculated using tax rates that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of
the reporting period. Income tax assets and liabilities are
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or
paid to the taxation authorities.

Current Tax

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of
the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end
of the reporting period. Management periodically evaluates
positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in
which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of
amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred Tax

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability
method, on temporary differences arising between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in
the financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined
using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and
are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax
asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible
temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is
probable that future taxable amounts will be available to
utilise those temporary differences and losses.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is
a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and
liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the
same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities
are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right
to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Current and deferred tax is recognised in statement of
profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to items
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly
in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

Uncertain tax positions

The management periodically evaluates positions taken in the
tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax
regulations are subject to interpretation and considers whether
itis probable that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain
tax treatment. The Group reflects the effect of uncertainty for
each uncertain tax treatment by using one of two methods,
the expected value method (the sum of the probability -
weighted amounts in a range of possible outcomes} or the
most likely amount {single most likely amount method in a
range of possible outcomes), depending on which is expected
to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty. The Group
applies consistent judgements and estimates if an uncertain
tax treatment affects both the current and the deferred tax.

Borrowing costs

General and specific borrowing costs that are directly
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production

215

2.16

of a qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of
time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for
its intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are assets that
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready
for their intended use or sale.

Investment income earned on the temporary investment of
specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying
assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for
capitalisation.

All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in
which they are incurred.

Provision and Contingencies

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present
legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle
the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

Provisions are measured at the present value of
management's best estimate of the expenditure required
to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting
period. The discount rate used to determine the present
value is ad pre-tax rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to
the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is
a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but
probably will not require an outflow of resources embodying
economic benefits or the amount of such obligation cannot
be measured reliably. When there is a possible obligation
or a present obligation in respect of which likelihood of
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is
remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

Employee benefits
a. Short-term obligations

Liabilities for wages and salaries, including other
monetary and non-monetary benefits that are
expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after
the end of the reporting period are recognised and
measured at the undiscounted amounts expected to
be paid when the liabilities are settled.

b.

Post-employment obligations (Defined Benefit
Obligations)

The Group operates the
employment schemes:

following —_ post-

° defined benefit plans - gratuity and post-
retirement medical benefit scheme

° defined contribution plans such as provident fund.

Defined Benefit Plans - Gratuity obligations and
post-retirement medical benefit obligations

The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet
in respect of gratuity is the present value of the
defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting
period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined
benefit obligation is calculated annually by actuaries
using the projected unit credit method.

The present value of the defined benefit obligation
is determined by discounting the estimated future
cash outflows by reference to market yields at the
end of the reporting period on government bonds
that have terms approximating to the terms of the
related obligation.

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the
discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit
obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is
included in employee benefit expense in the statement
of profit and loss. Remeasurement gains and losses
arising from experience adjustments and changes in
actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period
in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive
income. They are included in retained earnings in the
statement of changes in equity and in the balance
sheet. Changes in the present value of the defined
benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments
or curtailments are recognised immediately in the
statement of profit and loss as past service cost.

Compensated absences

The Group’s liabilities under for long term compensated
absences is determined on the basis of actuarial
valuation made at the end of each financial year using
the projected unit credit method except for short term
compensated absences which are provided for based
on estimates. The benefits are discounted using the

217

218

market yields at the end of the reporting period that
gave terms approximating to the terms of the related
obligation. Re-measurements as a result of experience
adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are
recognised in profit or loss.

Defined contribution plans

The Group pays provident fund contributions to
publicly administered provident funds and National
Pension Scheme (NPS} as per local regulations.
Group’s contribution to provident fund and NPS is
recognised on accrual basis in the Statement of Profit
and Loss. Group has no further payment obligations
once the contributions have been paid.

ce. Other long-term employee benefit obligations

The liabilities for long service awards and
compensated absences which are not expected to be
settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the
reporting period are measured at the present value
of expected future payments to be made in respect
of services provided by employees up to the end of
the reporting period, using the projected unit credit
method. Re-measurements as a result of experience
adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are
recognised in the statement of profit and Loss.

Segment reporting

The Board of Directors assesses performance of the Group
as Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). Operating
segments are reported in a manner consistent with the
internal reporting provided to the CODM.

The Group has a single major operating segment that is
“Sale of Natural Gas”. Accordingly, the segment revenue,
segment results, segment assets and segment liabilities
are reflected in the financial statements as at and for the
financial year ended March 31, 2025.

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the
profit after tax before other comprehensive income by the
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding
during the financial year. Diluted earnings per share is
computed by dividing the profit after tax by the weighted
average number of equity and dilutive equity equivalent
shares outstanding during the year, except where the
results would be anti-dilutive.

regulatory guidelines which mitigate risk.

These plans typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as:

Investment risk - The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by
reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bond yields; if the return on plan asset is below
this rate, it will create a plan deficit.

Interest rate risk - A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset
by an increase in the return on the plan’s debt investments. The expected rate of return on plan assets is determined after
considering several applicable factors such as the composition of the plan assets, investment strategy, market scenario, etc.

Demographic risk - This is the risk of variability of results due to unsystematic nature of decrements that include mortality,
withdrawal, disability and retirement. The effect of these decrements on the defined benefit obligation is not straight forward
and depends upon the combination of salary increase, medical cost inflation, discount rate and vesting criteria.

iii)

in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.
There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior years.

Other Long-term Employee Benefits

Compensated absences which are accumulated and not expected to be availed within twelve months after the end of the
reporting period in which the employee renders the related service are recognised as a liability at the present value of the
defined benefit obligation as at the balance sheet date. Long Service Awards are recognised as a liability based on actuarial
valuation of the defined benefit obligation as at the balance sheet date.

An amount of 76.18 crore (previous year %7.66 crore) and 2.69 crore (previous year 21.59 crore) has been charged to the
Statement of Profit and Loss towards Compensated absences and Long service awards respectively.

Actuarial assumptions for long-term compensated absences:

Salary risk - The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan & in Crore}
participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan's Liability. Particulars For the year ended

Attrition 4.58% to 15.00% 4.63% to 15.00%

Mortality risk: Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for lifetime and payable till retirement age only, plan does not
have any longevity risk.

The discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Government of India securities as at the balance sheet date for
the estimated term of the obligations.

the Group. The credit risk arises from trade receivables, security deposits, cash and cash equivalents and deposits with
banks and corporates.

Trade receivables

The Group has a diversified business portfolio. It supplies natural gas to customers. Group also supplies Liquefied
Natural Gas (LNG) to vehicles, providing services of compressing gas for the purpose of transportation using its
compression facility and sale of pipes and fittings required for construction of pipeline infrastructure.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited as majority credit sales are made to high
credit worthy entities and balance credit sales are against securities in the form of customer security deposits, bank
guarantees and letter of credit. All trade receivables are reviewed and assessed for default on regular basis. Our
historical experience of collecting receivables, supported by the level of default, is that credit risk is low.

Other financial assets

The Group maintains exposure in security deposits, reinstatement charges receivable, cash and cash equivalents and
term deposits with banks and corporates.

In the case of security deposits and reinstatement charges, the majority of which are given to Municipal authorities
(which are government-controlled entities) towards pipeline laying activity, the credit risk is low. However, historically
the Group has experienced a delay/ non receipt of these amounts and hence allowances have been taken into account
for the expected credit losses of these security deposits and reinstatement charges.

In the case of bank/corporate fixed deposits regular quotations for interest rate are invited and based on best offered
rate the bank deposits are placed with banks/corporates having reasonably high net worth. Exposures of deposit
placed are restricted to limits per bank/corporate as per policy and limits are actively monitored by the Group. We
understand that the credit risk is very low to moderate for such deposits.

The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of each class of financial assets as disclosed in note
4,5, 8, 9,10 and 11.

Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will find it difficult in meeting its obligations associated with its financial
liabilities on time.

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability
of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due and to close
out market positions. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group’s treasury maintains flexibility in
funding by maintaining availability under cash and cash equivalents, bank fixed deposits, corporate fixed deposits
and mutual funds.

Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity position and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of
expected cash flows.

Foreign Exchange Risk

Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from direct transactions in foreign currency and also indirectly
through transactions denominated in foreign currency though settled in functional currency {INR), primarily with respect
to the US Dollar (USD). Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and
liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the Group’s functional currency {INR).

The risk is measured through a forecast of highly probable foreign currency cash flows. As per the risk management
policy, the foreign currency exposure is unhedged, however managed partially through natural hedge under gas sales
contracts and balance through adjustment in sales prices.

The table below shows the unhedged currency exposure of financial liabilities:

their demat accounts/ websites of Depositories/
Depository Participants. Demat account holders
would be able to cast their vote without having
to register again with the ESPs, thereby, not only
