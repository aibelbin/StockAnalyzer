Independent Auditor's Review Report on Standalone Unaudited Quarterly Financial Results of the
Company pursuant to Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)
Regulations, 2015 (as amended)

To the Board of Directors of Finolex Industries Limited

1.

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of standalone unaudited financial results (the
Statement’) of Finolex Industries Limited (the ‘Company’) for the quarter ended 30 June 2025, being
submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) (‘Listing Regulations’).

The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s management and approved by the
Company’s Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and
measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting
(‘Ind AS 34’), prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the ‘Act’), and other
accounting principles generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the presentation and
disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility is to express a
conclusion on the Statement based on our review.

We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements
(SRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the
Entity, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information
consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and
applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit
conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act,
and consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

Based on our review conducted as above and consideration of review report of the auditor of Finolex
Industries Employees’ Welfare Trust (the ‘Welfare Trust’) as referred to in paragraph 5 below, nothing
has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in
accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under
section 133 of the Act, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed
the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 of the
Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material
misstatement.

Independent Auditor's Review Report on Standalone Unaudited Quarterly Financial Results of the
Company pursuant to Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)
Regulations, 2015 (as amended) (Cont'd)

5. We did not review the interim financial information of the Welfare Trust included in the Statement,
whose financial information reflects total revenue of ZNil, total net profit after tax of 8.44 crore and
total comprehensive income of %8.44 crore for the quarter ended 30 June 2025, as considered in the
Statement. This interim financial information has been reviewed by the other auditor whose review
report has been furnished to us by the management, and our conclusion, in so far as it relates to the
amounts and disclosures included in respect of the Welfare Trust, is based solely on the review report
of such other auditor of the Welfare Trust.

Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter with respect to our reliance on the work done
by and the report of the other auditor.
