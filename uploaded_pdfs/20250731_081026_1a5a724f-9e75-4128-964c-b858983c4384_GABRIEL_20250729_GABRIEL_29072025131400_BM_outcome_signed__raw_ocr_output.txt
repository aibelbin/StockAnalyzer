Review Report

To

The Board of Directors

Gabriel India Limited

29th Milestone, Pune-Nashik Highway,
Village Kuruli, Taluka Khed,

Pune- 410501, Maharashtra

1. We have reviewed the unaudited financial results of Gabriel India Limited (the “Company”) for the
quarter ended June 30, 2025, which are included in the accompanying ‘Statement of Standalone
Unaudited Financial Results for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 (the “Statement”). The Statement
has been prepared by the Company pursuant to Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (the “Listing Regulations, 2015”), which
has been stamped by us for identification purposes. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the
Company’s Management and approved by the Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance
with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34
“Interim Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act,
2013, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express a
conclusion on the Statement based on our review.

2. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements
(SRE) 2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the
Entity” issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This Standard requires that we plan
and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is free of material
misstatement.

3. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would
become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not
express an audit opinion.

4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe
that the Statement has not been prepared in all material respects in accordance with the recognition
and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standard and other
accounting principles generally accepted in India and has not disclosed the information required to be
disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, 2015 including the manner in which it
is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
