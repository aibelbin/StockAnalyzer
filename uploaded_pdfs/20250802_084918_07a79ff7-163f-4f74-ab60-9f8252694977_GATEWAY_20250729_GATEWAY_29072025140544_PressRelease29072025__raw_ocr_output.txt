* Financials include Total Revenue of INR 162.16 crores, EBIDTA of INR 25.09 crores, PBT of INR 3.95
crores and PAT of INR 2.54 crores due to consolidation of accounts after Snowman Logistics went from
being an Associate Company to a Subsidiary from December, 24 2024.

Prem Kishan Dass Gupta, Chairman & Managing Director, said, “On a year-on-year basis we see good
growth in volumes, revenue and EBITDA. Geopolitical and geoeconomic conditions are expected to
stabilise soon. The recently closed UK trade deal will be a positive for EXIM volumes and we are
hopeful for similar impact from EU and US trade deals which should boost volumes further. There are
some new opportunities available in the domestic segment, which we have already started in a small
way and will continue to expand on this. While we continue looking to acquire land for developing our
own ICDs, we are also exploring operating on an asset light model to grow our volumes.

Snowman continues to expand its presence with new capacity already added in Kolkata,
Krishnapatnam and Kundli (NCR) and plans are already in place to further add pallet capacity to new
and existing locations.
