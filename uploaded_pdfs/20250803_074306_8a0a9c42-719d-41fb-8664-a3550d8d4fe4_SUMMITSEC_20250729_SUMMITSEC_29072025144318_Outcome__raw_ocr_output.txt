Independent Auditor's review report on the unaudited standalone financial results for
the quarter ended June 30, 2025 of Summit Securities Limited pursuant to Regulation
33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as
amended,

To,

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
SUMMIT SECURITIES LIMITED

1. We have reviewed the accompanying unaudited standalone financial results of Summit
Securities Limited (the “Company") for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, which are
included in the accompanying ‘Statement of unaudited Standalone financial results for
the Quarter ended June 30, 2025 (the “Statement”) being submitted by the Company
pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of
India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended
(the "Listing Regulations, 2015"), including relevant circulars issued by the Securities and
Exchange Board of India (“SEBI") from time to time. We have initialed the Statement for
identification purposes only.

2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved
by the Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the
recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34
“Interim Financial Reporting” ("Ind AS 34"), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies
Act, 2013 (the “Act"), read with the relevant Rules issued thereunder, the circulars,
guidelines and directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India ("RBI") from time to time
(the “RBI Guidelines”) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, and is
in compliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 of the
Listing Regulations, 2015 including relevant circulars issued by SEBI from time to time
and that it has been prepared in accordance with the relevant prudential norms issued
by the RBI in respect of income recognition, assets classification, provisioning and other
related matters, to the extent those are not inconsistent with the Indian Accounting
Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act. Our responsibility is to issue a report
on the Statement based on our review.

3. We conducted our review in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (‘SRE’)
2410, ‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of
the Entity’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard
requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether
the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries
of company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus
provides less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly,
we do not express an audit opinion.

4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes
us to believe that the accompanying Statement has not been prepared in accordance
with recognition and measurement principles taid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under
Section 133 of the Act, read with the relevant Rules issued thereunder, the RBI Guidelines
and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, and has not disclosed the
information required to be disctosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation
33 of the Listing Regulations, 2015, including relevant circulars issued by SEB! from time

prudential norms issued by the RBI in respect of Income recognition, asset classification,
provisioning and other related matters, to the extent those are not inconsistent with the
Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the Act.

Other Matter

. Attention is drawn to the fact that the figures for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 as
reported in these unaudited standalone financial results are the balancing figures
between audited figures in respect of the full previous financial year and the published
unaudited year to date figures up to the third quarter of the previous financial year.

Our Conclusion is not modified in respect of the above matter.
