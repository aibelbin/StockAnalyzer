Brightcom Group to Launch New Division Dedicated to Next Generation Defence Technologies

Hyderabad, India - 1st August 2025: Brightcom Group Limited (BSE: 532368; NSE: BCG), a global leader in digital tech-
nologies, today announced the launch of a dedicated division focused on aerospace intelligence and autonomous aerial
defence software. This initiative represents a significant strategic expansion designed to leverage Brightcom’s long-stand-
ing expertise in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and real-time data processing into the defence sector, complement-
ing the company’s core digital marketing and advertising businesses.

Commenting on this strategic move, Suresh Reddy, Chairman and Managing Director of the group, stated, "This marks an
important milestone in our company's journey. By establishing this new division, we are looking to leverage our extensive
relationships to address the rapidly evolving market needs. This move will capitalise on our years of expertise in data-dri-
ven decision-making and our capabilities in Al and ML. It aligns perfectly with our objective of driving technological innova-
tion in high-impact sectors. The proposal will be tabled at the upcoming board meeting for formal discussion and approval.
In the weeks ahead, we look forward to unveiling the official name of the division and announcing the induction of a sea-
soned leadership team and esteemed advisors with proven credentials in defence and aerospace technologies. This initia-
tive sets the stage for the next version of Brightcom.”

The global landscape of defence is undergoing a paradigm shift, where Al-driven aerospace intelligence and autonomous
systems are redefining how nations secure their skies and borders. With the market for such technologies projected to sur-
pass USD 25 billion in the coming decade, the race for air-based dominance has become the cornerstone of modern secu-
rity strategies. Brightcom’s new division is designed to lead at this frontier - building next-generation software platforms that

combine intelligence, speed, and autonomy to transform aerial defence. With dedicated leadership and deep technological
expertise, Brightcom aims to forge strategic collaborations with governments, defence innovators, and global partners to
shape the future of indigenous and allied defence capabilities.

A key driver of modern defence transformation is the emergence of coordinated drone swarms - autonomous aerial systems
capable of operating in unison to deliver scalable, adaptive, and cost-efficient capabilities. Brightcom’s entry into this high-

impact domain marks a strategic lateral expansion of its core technological strengths into aerospace and defence.

For over 25 years, Brightcom has engineered sophisticated software systems that manage vast data flows, enable split-
second decision-making, and power complex digital ecosystems globally. These same foundational competencies - in arti-
ficial intelligence, machine learning, and real-time computing - are now being applied to next-generation aerial defence
technologies.

While continuing to lead in digital marketing and advertising, Brightcom is leveraging its deep technology stack to grow into
adjacent sectors where it can create meaningful value. This initiative reflects the company’s commitment to innovation and

diversification - into emerging arenas without losing focus on its core business.

The new division will focus on developing advanced software platforms that are integral to military and defence operations.
Key areas of specialisation will include:

+ Al-powered autonomous flight systems for UAVs, enabling intelligent navigation and mission execution

+ Real-time threat detection and response algorithms, designed to adapt dynamically to evolving battlefield condi-
tions

* Swarm coordination frameworks that facilitate synchronised operations across fleets of autonomous drones

+ Cybersecurity architectures tailored for aerial platforms, ensuring mission-critical data integrity and system re-
silience

+ High-fidelity simulation engines for mission planning, strategic modelling, and operational readiness

Together, these capabilities aim to deliver a comprehensive software stack for modern aerial defence - where speed, preci-
sion, and autonomy are paramount.
