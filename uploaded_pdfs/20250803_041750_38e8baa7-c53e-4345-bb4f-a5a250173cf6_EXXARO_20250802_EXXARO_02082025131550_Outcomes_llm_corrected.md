# NT AUDITOR'S REVIEW REPORT ON REVIEW OF UNAUDITED STANDALONE INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS

To: Board of Directors, Exxaro Tiles Limited

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of Unaudited Standalone Financial Results of Exxaro Tiles Limited (“the Company”) for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 ("the Statement") attached herewith, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended.

Current chunk to process:
SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s management and has been approved by the Company's Board of Directors, has been compiled from the related financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”) prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with relevant rules issued thereunder (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India.

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review of such standalone financial statements.

We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of the Company's personnel responsible for financial and accounting matters and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013 and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in aforesaid Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting practices and principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
