TCS assures govt: All job

URVI MALVANIA
Mumbai, August 1

TATA CONSULTANCY SER-
VICES (TCS) has assured the
ministry of labour that it
remains committed to hon-
ouring all job offers it has
made, even as it faces delays in
onboarding due to global mar-
ket challenges. The IT major
submitted its response via
email to the chief labour com-
missioner (CLC), citing
deferred client projects as the
reason behind the hold-up in
inducting new hires.

The labour ministry had
sought clarity from TCS fol-
lowing a complaint by the tech
employees’ union Nascent

which flagged delays in

affected candidates, mental
health support, and assistance
for those who have already
relocated. The union also
raised broader allegations,
including forced resignations
and violations of labour laws,
but the CLC observed that
these claims lacked supporting
documentation. NITES has
committed to submitting the
necessary evidence in due
course, after which the labour
office will review the matter
further and decide on schedul-
ing another meeting if needed.

TCS had earlierannounced
a global workforce realign-
ment as part of its broader
restructuring plan. The move
is expected to impact around
2% of its global headcount,
which is roughly 12,000
employees, as the company
gears up for a future-ready
operating model.

The labour ministry is
expected to monitor the situ-
ation closely in the coming
weeks.
