The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters specified in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) with respect to the preparation and presentation of these Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Ind-AS specified under section 133 of the Act.

This responsibility also includes its duty to maintain adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation, and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

3. Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these Financial Statements based on our audit. We have taken into account the provisions of the Act, the accounting and auditing standards, and matters which are required to be included in the audit report under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal financial control relevant to Xpro India Limited’s preparation and presentation of the Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by Xpro India Limited’s Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Financial Statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Financial Statements.

4. Opinion

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Financial Statements give the information required by the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including Ind-AS specified under section 133 of the Act, and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Xpro India Limited as at June 30, 2025, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the quarter then ended in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India.

      - (b) The Group has utilised Euro denominated export credit insurance-backed Supplier Credits in respect of capital goods, to be paid in instalments over ten years. While EUR/INR and EUR/AED exchange rates were seen to be generally range bound until March 2025, due to global movements a steep rise of 8.5% during the quarter in the EUR/INR and EUR/AED exchange rates has impacted the carrying value of the said Euro-denominated borrowings and accordingly the Group is required to provide a provision of INR 1672.49 lacs in its consolidated statement of Profit & Loss Account;
          - (c)_ It is prudent to point out that over the long-term tenure of the borrowings and their settlement, these fluctuations may not be Permanent and could potentially reverse or adjust as part of normal financial trends,
              $. The management has made reclassification in comparative information as per IND AS 8, “Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors* and its impact thereof is as below
