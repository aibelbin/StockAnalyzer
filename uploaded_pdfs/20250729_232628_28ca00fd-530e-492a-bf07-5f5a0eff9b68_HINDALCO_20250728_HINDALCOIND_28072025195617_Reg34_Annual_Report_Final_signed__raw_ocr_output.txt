INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25
HINDALCO INDUSTRIES LIMITED


To enrich lives, by
building dynamic and
responsible businesses
and Institutions, that
inspire trust

MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN

”

Dear Shareholders,

FY 2024-25 was a study in resilience
and dynamism, shaped by the push
and pull of uncertainty and the powerful
force of adaptive leadership. For the
Aditya Birla Group, it has been a year
of unprecedented growth and renewal.
The Group has been an engine of big
bets, moving with conviction across
multiple frontiers.

We witnessed, in vivid form, the bread!
depth, and scale of our businesses,
reflected in the sheer simultaneity of
strategic moves. New platforms were
launched and rapidly scaled— in

paints, in jewellery retail, and in B2B
e-commerce. At the same time, we
deepened leadership in our core sectors
like cement, metals, fibre, chemicals,
and financial services.

Each move was consequential on
its own. Together, they reflecta

rare dynamism. A kind of corporate
choreography. What enables it?

A distinctive alchemy of capital
strength, institutional talent, brand
equity, sectoral expertise, and trust,
carefully built over decades. Itis this
combination that has allowed us to
move swiftly and with clarity, even
amidst global uncertainty.

Global Outlook: Making Sense of
an Uncertain World

The global economy in 2024 proved
unexpectedly steady, growing at 3.3%,
only a shade below the 3.5% posted

a year earlier, despite persistent

noise and disruption. According to

the International Monetary Fund, this
resilience held firm against an unsettled
backdrop of inflationary pressures,
geopolitical fault lines, and fragmenting
trade ties. The United States, driven

by buoyant consumer and government
spending, led the developed world with
GDP growth of 2.8%. Yet this strength
stood in contrast to more subdued
performances across Asia and Europe.

China’s recovery, once a cornerstone
of global momentum, remained
hesitant. Sluggish consumer demand
and ongoing stress in the property
sector weighed heavily. In parallel,
investment levels across major
economies stagnated, productivity
gains stalled, and public debt remained
a growing concern.

Geopolitical tensions, now more
durable than episodic, compounded
market uncertainty. A more fragmented
world economy, shaped by competing
spheres of influence and rising trade
friction, added further complexity.

For the Aditya Birla Group, it has been a year of
unprecedented growth and renewal. The Group
has been an engine of big bets, moving with
conviction across multiple frontiers.

99

Yet not all signals were dim. Inflation
eased dropping from 6.6% in 2023

to 5.7% in 2024, reflecting tighter
monetary policy and a marked softening
of supply chain disruptions. Central
banks in advanced economies began
pivoting away from restrictive stances,
making financial conditions more
supportive, though not without caution.

Looking ahead, global growth is
expected to moderate to 2.8% in 2025
before edging up to 3.0% in 2026. Much
of the drag is expected from advanced
economies, with their collective growth
projected to slow from 1.8% to 1.4%.

Monetary easing and subsiding inflation
offer some tailwinds. Still, vulnerabilities
persist. Geopolitical conflict, high
borrowing costs, and deteriorating trade
dynamics remain formidable obstacles.
Inflation is projected to fall further to
4.3% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026, but
service sector inflation remains sticky,
and trade disruptions could yet spark
fresh cost pressures.

Merchandise trade, long the engine of
global growth, faces an uncertain future.
New tariffs and retaliatory measures
risk pulling global trade volumes into
contractionary territory. Encouragingly,
recent bilateral trade deals suggest that
diplomacy is not entirely off the table,
even as rhetoric hardens.

India in 2024-25: Standing Strong
in a Fractured World

India emerged as an outlier of stability
and momentum in a world adrift. With
projected GDP growth of 6.4-6.5%,

it retained its crown as the fastest-
growing major economy. The final
quarter surged to 7.4%, powered by
construction, manufacturing, and
sustained government capital outlay.

Policy credibility, macroeconomic
resilience, and diversified growth
engines underpinned this performance.
Consumption rebounded and exports
rose. Agriculture benefited from
favourable monsoons and strong
foodgrain output. Services, still

India’s growth mainstay, grew by

7.2%, accounting for over half of gross
value added.

India’s export story was particularly
telling. Merchandise and services
exports reached an all-time high of US$
824.9 billion, up 6.01% year-on-year, a
feat few economies could match amid
global headwinds.

Inflation, a lingering concern globally,
trended down decisively. The headline
rate eased to 4.6%, from 5.4% a year
earlier, helped by effective supply-side
interventions, softening input costs, and
timely monetary policy adjustments.
The Reserve Bank of India moved from
tightening to a neutral stance in October
2024, then back to accommodative in
April 2025.

The financial system stood firm.
Balance sheets strengthened and asset
quality improved. Loan growth remained
in double digits. Yields softened across
government and corporate debt,
reinforcing investor confidence.

India enters the new fiscal year

with tailwinds intact. GDP growth is
projected at 6.5%, with risks well-
balanced. Consumption is expected to
pick up further. Public investment will
likely remain a key growth lever, while
fiscal consolidation continues.

In an era of disruption and dynamism, the Aditya Birla
Group has held firm to a foundational conviction that
people are the ultimate differentiator.

J

Manufacturing momentum is expected
to build, supported by the Production
Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and the
new National Manufacturing Mission.
Infrastructure will remain a priority,
buoyed by initiatives under Gati Shakti,
higher allocations for affordable
housing, and a renewed push under the
Asset Monetisation Plan.

The external sector outlook, though
exposed to global turbulence, remains
cautiously optimistic. Ongoing trade
negotiations and regional partnerships
offer a buffer against a volatile

trade landscape.

While global financial market

volatility, geopolitical tensions, and
trade fragmentation pose downside
risks, India's sound macroeconomic
fundamentals, robust financial sector,
and commitment to sustainable
growth position the economy to remain
the fastest-growing major economy

in 2025-26.

Aditya Birla Group: Investing in
People, Leading with Purpose

In an era of disruption and dynamism,
the Aditya Birla Group has held firm

toa foundational conviction that
people are the ultimate differentiator.
In FY 2024-25, this-belief took

on new urgency and new scale.

Our investments in talent, culture,

and capability were not just deepened,
but future aligned.

Through the year, 13,233 professionals
joined us in the management cadre across
businesses, 76% of whom were under the
age of 35. This surge in Gen Z hiring marks
a deliberate pivot to next-generation talent
that is digital-first, agile, and ambitious.
Diversity hiring accounted for 18%,
reflecting our continued commitment to
inclusion as a business strategy.

A robust pipeline of talent is the
cornerstone of any sustainable
business. Internal hiring rose to 76%

at senior levels (up from 72%) and to
70% at mid- and junior levels (from
54%), reinforcing our commitment to
growing from within. Among critical
senior leadership roles, 67% were filled
by planned successors, 19% by other
internal talent, and only 14% externally.
These figures reflect a healthy blend of
self-reliance and fresh perspective. The
engine behind this momentum is a mix
of structured leadership programmes,
mobility frameworks, and strong
mentorship architecture.

Learning and development remained

the cornerstone of our people strategy.
Gyanodaya, our Leadership and
Learning Centre, inaugurated a new
158,000 sq. ft. campus with cutting-edge
infrastructure and immersive learning
technologies. Over 6,300 learners
attended programmes across future skills,
leadership, and functional competencies.
The Gyanodaya Virtual Campus, our
digital learning platform, saw participation
from 92% of our workforce, touching
nearly 60,000 employees.

Our Learning Fest, a three-month
Group-wide initiative, brought
future-critical themes like digital
transformation, data analytics, growth
mindset, and inspirational leadership, to
the fore. More than 10,000 employees
participated, from factory floors to
corporate offices, reflecting a culture
where learning is universal.

Equally, we recognise that high
performance must be underpinned by
well-being. The Group took significant
strides in mental and physical

health support this year. Awareness
programmes, counselling services, and
a network of trained Emotional First
Aiders provided critical care to over
1,400 employees and family members.
In Mumbai, 99.5% of eligible employees
completed annual health check-ups.
Across the Group, businesses tailored
wellness initiatives to local contexts,
ensuring impact with empathy.

Employee engagement levels remain
among the highest in the industry.
Our internal survey, ABG Vibes 2025,
reported a 91% engagement score.
87% of employees indicated a strong
intent to build long-term careers within
the Group. These numbers not only
exceed external benchmarks but also
speak to the emotional equity we have
built over time.

Our people philosophy extends beyond
the workplace. Through the A World

of Opportunities Foundation, 203
scholarships were awarded to students
from underprivileged backgrounds.
Over 33,000 employees contributed
6.7 crore, reflecting a deep culture of
giving. Since inception, nearly 5,000
scholarships have been granted,

and more than 2,000 alumni are now
gainfully employed across India.
Meanwhile, our Deep Volunteering
programme enabled 250 employees to
contribute directly to grassroots causes,
with 16 selected for immersive NGO
engagements in remote areas—living,
learning, and giving back.

The year culminated with meaningful
external recognition. The Aditya Birla
Group was named a Top Employer 2025,
in India by the Top Employers Institute

and featured among Forbes World’s Best
Employers. These accolades reaffirm our
belief that our people are the key to our
continued success. And in building a world
of opportunities for our people, we deepen
our own purpose as a force for good.

Your Company’s Performance

FY 2024-25 was a landmark year
in Hindalco’s journey. Amidst
global turbulence—ranging
from raw material volatility and
inflationary pressures to rising
geopolitical tensions and the
intensifying call for climate
action—your Company not only
delivered its strongest financial
performance to date, but also
stayed resolutely focused on
shaping a sustainable, future-
ready enterprise.

Despite challenges, your Company’s
consolidated revenues reached a record
%2,38,496 crore, while EBITDA rose by
38% to an all-time high of 735,496 crore.
Net profit stood at 716,002 crore, up 58%
year-on-year, reflecting the resilience of
its integrated model, strong execution,
and prudent capital discipline.

Key performance highlights

EBITDA

Net Profit

This performance was driven by robust
contributions from its India Aluminium
and Copper businesses, complemented
by stable performance from Novelis
despite tighter scrap markets and

cost headwinds.

FY 2024-25 laid the groundwork

for Hindalco’s long-term strategic
imperatives, which aim to drive

its next wave of growth and value
creation. The long-term growth
agenda is anchored in strengthening
upstream and downstream businesses,
deepening its sustainability
commitments, and enhancing
stakeholder value. Your Company is
doubling down on upstream capacities
through significant investments in
aluminium and copper smelting,

along with an 850 KTPA greenfield
alumina refinery. Simultaneously, your
Company is targeting a quadrupling of
its downstream EBITDA by FY 2029-30
over the FY 2023-24 base by
expanding its portfolio of value-added
products across aluminium, copper,
specialty alumina, and recycling. Your
Company's planned investments of
over US$10 billion over the next five
years, equally split between India and
Novelis, will build capacity, increase
premiumisation, and reinforce its
competitive advantage.

Hindalco’s Aluminium India Upstream
operations retained its position in the
first quartile of the global cost curve,
with Utkal Alumina continuing to rank
among the world’s most efficient
refineries. The Aluminium Downstream
business scaled up its presence in
emerging applications, including
electric vehicle components, packaging
foils, and aerospace alloys. Ina key
milestone, it successfully delivered
10,000 aluminium battery enclosures,
underscoring its push into next-
generation mobility.

Your Company’s Copper business, too,
registered its best-ever performance,
driven by high value-added product
volumes and stable, efficient plant

Hindalco Industries Limited
Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

operations. Strategic projects like

the brownfield expansion of its Dahej
smelter to over 700 KTPA, the Inner
Grooved Tube plant, and India’s first
copper and multi-metal recycling
facility are progressing well. These
developments will allow it to substitute
imports, tap into green energy demand,
and create circular solutions in the
copper value chain.

Your Company’s Specialty Alumina
business continued to demonstrate
strong momentum in FY 2024-25,
reinforcing Hindalco’s position among
the top three global producers. With a
highly diversified product portfolio and
strong customer engagement across
sectors like ceramics, flame retardants,
catalysts, and battery materials,

the business is well positioned to
capture emerging demand trends. It
remains on track to scale capacity to

1 million tonnes over the next three

to five years, supported by targeted
investments in white fused alumina and
precipitated hydrate.

Novelis, meanwhile, continued to
deepen its leadership in flat-rolled
aluminium products and recycling.
Novelis delivered shipments of 3.76
million tonnes and Adjusted EBITDA of
US$1.8 billion in FY 2024-25. Novelis’
performance this year also marked

a decisive push towards long-term
decarbonisation and circularity through
its 3x30 vision. This strategy is centred
on increasing recycled content to 75%,
lowering the carbon footprint of its rolled
products to under three tonnes of CO,
per tonne, and maintaining industry-
leading returns on invested capital.
This positions Novelis as a frontrunner
in offering aluminium as the material of

choice for circular, low-carbon solutions.

This year, Hindalco was recognised
among the Top 1% of aluminium
companies globally in the S&P Global
Corporate Sustainability Assessment,
an honour shared by only three Indian
companies out of 7,600 assessed

worldwide. This speaks to our deep-
rooted commitment to building a
business that balances performance
with purpose—one that strives for
carbon neutrality, circularity, water
positivity, and biodiversity preservation,
not just by 2050, but starting now.

During FY 2024-25, we also unveiled
Hindalco’s new Masterbrand, an identity
that captures both our distinctive position
today and also the ambitious future we
are determined to engineer. From its
origins in Renukoot to becoming a global
metals powerhouse, Hindalco’s journey
has been defined by bold thinking and
relentless execution. The Masterbrand
is a declaration of this evolution, from

a material supplier to an engineered
solutions provider. It celebrates its
transformation into a co-creator,
innovator, and problem solver across
next-generation applications—from
EVs, renewables, and semiconductors
to defence, aerospace, and sustainable
packaging. Hindalco is now reimagining
how metals can enable India’s and the
world’s transition to a greener, faster, and
more digital future.

As your Company looks forward,

the megatrends of energy transition,
circularity, digitisation, and mobility will
continue to reshape the metals industry.
Hindalco is uniquely positioned to lead
this transformation, with a fully integrated
value chain, a disciplined capital
allocation framework, and a strong
foundation of operational excellence.

Guided by a future-ready strategy rooted
in sustainability, innovation, and growth,
your Company is poised to lead the
global metals transition and unlock long-
term value across the aluminium and
copper value chains.

Conclusion

| have long believed that the stronger we
grow, the greater the impact we create.
Growth, for us, is a force multiplier.

It compels us to widen the aperture—
to think more boldly about the difference

we can make. It energises us to leverage
our scale, resources, and leadership

to deliver disproportionately better
outcomes for all our stakeholders—
employees, consumers, partners,
investors, and society at large.

This dynamic interplay, of purpose

and performance, underpinned by our
proven ability to synthesise capital,
talent, and ideas, is what will shape

a truly transformative future. And
through this journey, we will continue to
demonstrate, with quiet conviction, the
enduring power of business as a force
for good.

downstream fabrication, and recycling

- cater to sectors including automotive,
aerospace, building and construction,
consumer durables, pharma and food
packaging, and industrial machinery.
Moreover, we have expansion plans for
our Indian operations across businesses

Consistent Performance
Excellence

Building on a foundation of strong
financial discipline and strategic
foresight, we have been delivering
consistently ina dynamic global
environment. In FY 2024-25, we
delivered a standout financial
performance, achieving an all-time high
EBITDA of 335,496 crore and a Profit
After Tax of 716,002 crore. Moreover,
we have significantly strengthened

our financial position over the past
decade while driving sustained growth
and substantially reducing debt. Our
EBITDA has expanded at a 13% CAGR
since FY 2013-14, and EPS has risen
ata 19% CAGR to 272.05 per share. At
the same time, our net debt to EBITDA

growth initiatives over the next 3-5
years. Through these significant
investments we are building a
future-ready enterprise poised to
meet evolving needs.

India’s aluminium demand is projected
to double in the next 10 years,
prompting a strategic scale-up of

our upstream operations. At Aditya,
we are expanding the smelter and
commissioning an 850,000 TPA
alumina refinery (Secured through

a bauxite alliance with the Orissa
Mining Corporation). For this facility,
we have pioneered the adoption of
round-the-clock renewable energy,
marking a first for India's aluminium

operations in Gujarat by FY 2026-27.
Designed to scale from 50 KT to 200 KT,
the plant will recover valuable metals
while playing a pivotal role in formalising
India’s unorganised e-waste sector

and subsequently advancing circular
economy objectives.

India’s demand for specialty alumina

is growing at twice the global rate.

Our Specialty Alumina portfolio

spans sectors such as flame-retardant
materials, batteries, electronics, ceramics,
and catalysts, with shipment volumes
surpassing 500,000 tonnes per annum.

can cast up to 240 KT of sheet ingot andis
expected to reduce our carbon emissions
by more than one million tonnes annually.

We also commissioned a US$65 million
recycling and casting center at our UAL
joint venture in South Korea. Funded by
Novelis, this facility will produce 100 KT
of low-carbon sheet ingot each year and
is expected to cut carbon emissions by
over 420 KT annually once itis fully up
and running. Looking ahead, our US$90
million investment in Latchford, UK, will
increase the facility's used beverage
can (UBC) recycling capacity by 85 KT
per year, more than doubling its current

capacity. This is another example of how
we're investing in smart, sustainable

ensuring self-sufficiency in our captive
coal supply. Waste utilisation is another
key priority. With acommitment to
achieve Zero Waste, we are utilising
over 100% of our fly ash and over
111% of our bauxite residue

(3 out of 4 refineries).

Responsible water stewardship is
embedded in our operations across

all sites. With the adoption of NITI
Aayog’s water neutrality framework

of 3M+7R (map, monitor, measure +
reduce, recycle, recover, replenish,
recharge, rejuvenate, recognise/
respect), efforts toward water neutrality
have accelerated, with 16 of our 19 sites
achieving Zero Liquid Discharge

(ZLD). We are also focused on
ecosystem restoration and biodiversity
preservation to ensure that our progress
aligns with ecological responsibility.

At our Novelis operations, we are
driving sustainability through our
3x30 Vision, a strategic framework

the aluminium industry toward
amore circular and low-carbon
future by 2030.

We are increasing the average recycled
content in our products from 63% to
75%, reinforcing our commitment to
circularity across our portfolio. We are
also reducing the carbon footprint of our
aluminium flat-rolled products from just
over 4 tCO,¢ per tonne to below 3 tCO,e
per tonne shipped.

Our unwavering focus on responsible
business practices has earned us global
recognition. For the fifth consecutive

In alignment with national decarbonisation
goals, we have already commissioned 190
MW of our targeted 300 MW renewable
energy capacity and remain on track to
reduce our GHG intensity by 25% by 2030
reinforcing our commitment to net-zero
emissions by 2050. We are also embedding
circularity and resource efficiency across
our operations, investing in energy-
efficient technologies, and exploring green
hydrogen use across select facilities. We
are capitalising on the demand for low-
carbon products through our Aluminium
Stewardship Initiative (ASI)- certified
operations and expanding our offerings in
copper busbars, tubes, and conductors
tailored for renewable applications.

The automotive sector's shift to
electrification is also boosting copper
demand, with electric vehicles (EVs)
requiring 3 to 4 times more copper than
their Internal Combustion Engine (ICE)
vehicle counterparts.’ We are enabling
this transition by providing lightweight,
high-performance materials that support
energy efficiency and emission reduction.
We are enabling this transition through
our copper products engineered for

EV wiring, charging infrastructure, and
battery connections, alongside lightweight
aluminium solutions that improve vehicle
range and efficiency.

Additionally, the aerospace and defence
sectoris emerging as a strategic growth
opportunity. As global demand rises

for high-strength, lightweight materials,
and aluminium alloys are becoming
critical for aircraft, satellites, and defence
applications we are scaling our value-
added portfolio to cater to this high-
specification, premium segment. This is
reinforcing our role as a solutions provider
in advanced manufacturing.

Novelis continues to embed sustainability
across its operations in alignment with
five key global trends. With a clear
roadmap towards net-zero, the Company
is scaling its closed-loop recycling
systems, increasing recycled content,

ongoing rise in per capita aluminum and
copper consumption and accelerated
urbanisation, Novelis is scaling its local
manufacturing footprint through strategic
capacity expansions, supporting greener
infrastructure, mobility, and packaging
solutions across its global markets.

To stay ahead of disruptive shifts in
technology and changing consumer
demand, there is an increase in investment
in digitalisation, Al-driven automation, and
advanced product development. These
efforts are geared towards next-generation
applications such as electric vehicles,
renewable energy systems, and circular
packaging. With a focus on lightweighting,
premiumisation, and regional
customisation, the Company continues to
co-develop sustainable, high-performance
aluminum solutions with its partners.

With focused strategic investments,
continuous innovation, and a steadfast

Functions, Sites, and Clusters

We follow a dual approach to risk
identification, comprising a bottom-up
process that empowers business
units to escalate operational risks,
and a top-down assessment by
senior leadership to evaluate
strategic, macroeconomic, and
emerging risks. These inputs are
consolidated using a structured 6x6
risk matrix that incorporates both
qualitative and quantitative criteria to
ensure a comprehensive risk profile.
Risk exposure is reviewed every
quarter at the Board-level committee.

To assess the likelihood and impact
of risk fruition, we apply a structured
risk scoring matrix across all domains.
This includes analysing historical
incident data, benchmarking industry
standards, monitoring environmental
trends, conducting stress testing and
scenario analysis in areas such as
climate change. Mitigation strategies
are subsequently implemented,
ensuring a systematic, proactive, and
risk-informed approach to managing
uncertainties.

Our Risk Appetite Framework

is strategically aligned with our
long-term goals, financial strength,
and regulatory obligations. We
maintain alow appetite for risks
related to safety, compliance, and
ESG — reflecting our commitment to
responsible operations. A moderate
appetite guides our approach

to strategic and financial risks,
balancing growth with stability,
while a higher appetite is reserved
for innovation and emerging
technologies, fostering agility

and transformation.

Hindalco's risk management process
is both comprehensive and proactive,
ensuring a holistic impact assessment
across the six capitals through the
3C+2S framework (Cash, Cost,
Customer, Safety & Sustainability,
Systems & Processes). Our strategic
planning balances resource allocation
across all six capitals.

Internal audits are conducted

annually by our Manufacturing

Centre of Excellence (MCoE) team

to review adherence to frameworks
and compliance standards, while
external audits are conducted
periodically by independent auditors
to assess effectiveness and regulatory
compliance. The findings from these
audits are reviewed by the Audit
Committee and the Risk Management
team to drive continuous improvements
and address any identified
Non-Conformities (NCs).

To cultivate an effective risk culture,
we have implemented comprehensive,
organisation-wide strategies.

Our non-executive directors receive
regular risk education through annual
sessions on key risk areas, quarterly
briefings, and workshops with
industry experts. Furthermore,
across business units, we conduct
focused trainings for new employees,
risk champions, and coordinators

to strengthen risk awareness and
identification capabilities.

During the reporting year, we
conducted over 8,500 hours of
training on various aspects of risk
management. At the operational level,
plant-specific trainings emphasised
safety, environmental compliance,

and operational risks, reinforced
through regular mock drills and
scenario-based simulations. In parallel,
specialised sessions on cybersecurity
and data protection were delivered

by IT experts to strengthen digital
resilience. Our crisis management and
business continuity programmes further
equipped teams with the skills needed
for effective emergency response

and stakeholder communication.
Additionally, members of our core

risk team, including Risk Managers,
were formally certified through the
BS!’s Certified Risk Professional
(CRiSP) programme, to sharpen

their skill sets.

Accountability is built into our
performance systems. The incentives
for senior management are directly
linked to compliance with risk mitigation
protocols, achievement of key risk
indicators (KRIs), and fulfillment of safety
and environmental objectives. Further,
emphasis on risk performance is a core
component of our quarterly and monthly
business reviews (QBRs and MBRs),
ensuring integration of risk management
and business performance. This
integration extends to performance
evaluation, where performance in safety
and environmental compliance directly
influences variable compensation,
ensuring risk management is a
fundamental component of our

reward system.

This structured approach underscores
our unwavering dedication to
maintaining a resilient and sustainable
business environment, fostering a
culture of continuous improvement
and proactive risk management
across all levels of the organisation.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

We recognise that identifying and
focusing on the most relevant
environmental, social, and governance
(ESG) topics is essential to driving
sustainable business performance
and long-term stakeholder value. Our
materiality assessment is a critical part
of this effort as it helps us determine
which issues matter the most to our
stakeholders and to the future success
of our business.

We have been conducting detailed
materiality assessment every two
years, with review from management on
annual basis, to identify and prioritise
key stakeholder concerns. The previous
materiality assessment exercise was
conducted in FY 2022-23, supported
by the insights of our stakeholders and
guided by the GRI Standards 2021.

In FY 2024-25, we carried out a
detailed materiality assessment in
alignment with the concept of double
materiality, through a structured
stakeholder consultation. The
assessment considered best-in-class
international practices, aligned with
globally recognised frameworks and
standards, including Global Reporting
Initiative (GRI) Standards 2021,
European Sustainability Reporting
Standards (ESRS), Sustainability
Accounting Standards Board (SASB),
World Economic Forum (WEF) ESG
Framework, MSCI ESG Ratings,

and sector-specific insights from the
Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI).

The double materiality approach comprises two aspects:

Financial Materiality

Determined by the risks and
opportunities, this factor considers the
impact on the organisation’s financials.

Impact Materiality

Determined by the scale, scope, and
irreversible nature of the impact, this
factor considers the effects on both
people and the environment.

We followed a seven-step approach to determine our material topics as prioritised by
internal and external stakeholders:

Define Scope, Approach
and Boundary

model, products, services, value
chain, and geographic locations.

Opportunities (IRO)

+ Identify and review relevant

Outcome of Materiality Assessment

Following a comprehensive
assessment of impact and financial
materiality, we developed a materiality
matrix that categorised 16 topics

as crucial, 5 as significant, and 2 as

low significance. The materiality matrix
has been evaluated and signed off by
our Board. These topics are integrated
into our ERM framework, which is also
aligned with the Global Risks Report of

Materiality Matrix

World Economic Forum (WEF) as well
as requirements of Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and
World Business Council on Sustainable
Development (WBCSD).

as automotive, aerospace and defence,
infrastructure, electricals, packaging,
and consumer goods.

At Novelis, the 3x30 Vision underscores
its dedication to circularity, reducing
carbon intensity, and delivering returns
on strategic investments. Novelis aims
to increase the recycled content of its
products from 63% to 75% across its
portfolio. The Company is also focused
on lowering the carbon footprint of its
aluminium rolled products (generated
as discards) from 4 to 3 tonnes per
tonnes. Novelis remains committed

to maintaining its leadership in

Return on Invested Capital (ROIC),
with continued emphasis on a strong
balance sheet, healthy cash flows, and
shareholder returns.

Key Focus Areas

Hindalco is poised to enter a phase of
accelerated growth backed by robust
resource security in alumina and coal.
We are scaling up a differentiated
high-value portfolio across the
value-chain, to drive value and
margin-accretive growth.

Prudent Capital
Structure

In FY 2024-25, Hindalco used an
optimal mix of internal cash and
external borrowings to finance its
growth initiatives and organic expansion
plans. This consistent strategy keeps
us aligned with our goal of maintaining

a strong leverage position and

balance sheet.

Our Consolidated Net Debt-to-EBITDA
ratio as on March 31, 2025 was 1.06x,
as against 1.21x as on March 31, 2024.

On aconsolidated basis, our Debt-to-
Equity ratio as on March 31, 2025 was
0.52x, lower compared to 0.53x as on
March 31, 2024. This, when looked

at along with the improvement in our
Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio, reflects

the strength of our balance sheet,

and bodes well for our goal of strong
financial position and creating long-term
value for our stakeholders.

At Novelis, our net debt witnessed a
slight increase to 743,485 crore,, while
at Hindalco India operations we have
anet cash position of 7,187 crore.
The interest expenses in FY 2024-25
were down compared to FY 2023-24,
primarily due to lower average

interest rates on our borrowings

Novelis:

Novelis, as the global market leader
in aluminium flat roll products,

and the world’s largest aluminium
recycler, has a diversified portfolio,
catering to key sectors like beverage
can sheet, automotive, aerospace,
and specialties.

Novelis is investing ~US$5 billion on
organic growth expansion projects
over the next 3-5 years. This includes
~US$330 million worth of investments
in Logan (US), Oswego (US), and
Pinda (Brazil), and debottlenecking
projects which will together yield an
additional capacity of 175 KT. Our
US$4.1 billion investment on the Bay
Minette plant will increase our FRP
capacity by 600 KT. Taken together
with the above capacity additions, we
expect our total capacity to be ~5,000
KT. We are making investments in
recycling and casting centers, by

seeking inputs from our customers
with respect to their expectations
from high recycle content.

The US$365 million Guthrie

facility, with a casting capacity of
240 KT, is expected to cut over 1
million tonnes of CO, emissions
annually. Likewise, the UAL centre
in South Korea, built at a cost of
US$65 million, contributes 100 kt

of low-carbon casting capacity and
is estimated to reduce emissions

by 420 KT. Novelis is also scaling

its Latchford facility with a US$90
million investment aimed at doubling
its recycling capacity, underscoring
its focus on sustainable operations.
To drive circularity and improve cost
effectiveness, Novelis is advancing
its scrap sorting capabilities—
enabling greater use of lower-grade
and post-consumer scrap, including
end-of-life automobiles. These
efforts are also strengthening
closed-loop systems with customers,
reinforcing Novelis’ leadership in the
shift toward low-carbon aluminium.

India Business:

Over the past 10 years, the operational
reliability and resilience of the India
business has been our key differentiator
vis-a-vis peers, and we have made
organic investments in our business. This
includes both upstream and downstream
across businesses and investments in AC
Fins, Battery foils, Inner Grooved Tubes,
Recycling, White Fused Alumina and
large downstream expansions in Silvassa
extrusion plant, the battery enclosure plant
in Chakan, and the ongoing rolling plant

in Aditya.

Hindalco’s integrated operations combined
with strategic resource access and focus
on value-added solutions, sets the stage
for meaningful margin expansion across
allsegments of the India business. The
Company's ongoing projects in both
Upstream and Downstream across
businesses will lead to margin expansions
and volume growth, supported by
operational excellence, captive raw
materials, with sustainability at the core.

Hindalco plans to double down its upstream
capacity to nearly 2 million tonnes in
aluminium and in copper to 1.2 million
tonnes considering the expansion that are
under execution and under evaluation.

Cost optimisation
though resource
securitisation

Resource securitisation

At Hindalco, our advantage comes from
our integrated operations delivering
cost efficiency, and quality. Despite
macro challenges, we are the front
runner in First Quartile Cost Curve
position in aluminium with industry
leading margins.

Our cost position is going to witness
apositive shift, with better cost
efficiencies derived by raw material
securitisation, and strengthening
our objective of sustained growth. In
FY 2024-25, our coal requirements
were met primarily by linkages and
spot purchases, with 2% derived
from renewable sources and our
own coal mines.

We have opted for a phased energy
transition strategy to reduce
dependency on external coal by having
our own coal mines and increase the
share of renewable energy in the next
3-5 years.

By FY 2028-29, we expect our coal-
based linkage and spot purchases

to decline by the gradual ramp-up of
captive coal consumption accounting
for 35-40% of our energy mix. At

the same time, renewable energy is
projected to meet approximately 17% of
our total requirements.

In the next phase, by FY 2032-33, we
aim to optimise energy self-reliance,
with ~70% of energy sourced through
our captive coal mines and ~30%
from renewable sources, reflecting
our commitment to sustainable
energy diversification.

Value enhancement
through portfolio
enrichment

We continue to enrich our portfolio in
downstream products and solutions.
With an ambition to expand downstream
across aluminium, copper and
speciality alumina. We have allocated
around US$2 billion towards these
projects. These experiments will lead

to quadruple Hindalco's downstream
EBITDA by FY 2029-30 from the base
of FY 2023-24,

Traditional practices for food storage
has been as using cloth or paper,
which retain moisture and promote
bacterial growth in India’s warm
climate. Freshwrapp is driving
awareness around safe, modern,

and hygienic food storage. Tests

by NABL-approved laboratories
confirmed that Freshwrapp resists
bacteria penetration for up to 36 hours
{11 micron) and up to 48 hours (18
micron), including against common
foodborne pathogens such as e.coli in
one line, salmonella, staphylococcus
aureus, and candida. The study

also showed that when non-users
were introduced to Freshwrapp

foil, their willingness to switch
increased substantially.

Expanding our Reach
and Impact

The post-pandemic years have seen

a series of global shocks, however,

the world economy has remained
broadly stable and resilient. Despite
ongoing geopolitical tensions and trade
uncertainties, the IMF projects global
growth at 2.8% in 2025, with a recovery
to 3.0% in 2026. In parallel, the Indian
economy is poised for strong growth
going forward, as the demand story
remains intact, and the macroeconomic
fundamentals are aligning to support
continued expansion. Growth
projections for India remain positive,
with the IMF forecasting that India shall
grow between 6.2% and 6.5% over the
coming years.

Against this backdrop, global demand for
aluminium and copper is rising, driven by
ashift toward sustainable solutions and
increased usage across the electrical,

Freshwrapp’s Innovative Freshlock Shield

Freshwrapp’s aluminium foilis
ISl-certified and versatile, perfect for
wrapping, storing, cooking, freezing,
and even serving. Consumer trials
show that non-users found it easy

to use, effective in retaining food
freshness, and a clear improvement
over traditional materials, which often
leave food soggy and prone to spoilage.

While aluminium foil is not reusable

and doesn't absorb oil, users across

the board ranked Freshwrapp high on
hygiene, convenience, and freshness.
Freshwrapp, has become India’s most
preferred aluminium foil brand. It serves
over 1.2 million households every month
and has been recognised as ‘Superbrand’
for the past three consecutive years.

automotive, building and construction
sectors. We are well-positioned to meet
this demand by doubling our production
capacity in the coming years and
reinforcing our role as a key enabler of
industrial growth.

Expansions at Aluminium
Upstream

In our upstream locations, we have
achieved an integrated alumina
capacity of 3.81 million MT through
planned brownfield expansions and
debottlenecking projects at various
sites. At Utkal, the debottlenecking
project was successfully
commissioned and stabilised,
elevating the refinery’s current capacity
to 2.6 million MTPA. Parallelly, we are
undertaking a greenfield expansion
project to set up an 850 KTPA capacity
refinery at Aditya, Odisha. This project
is expected to be commissioned by
FY 2027-28 and will further strengthen
the company’s backward integration
and resource security. Further, we are
undertaking a 180 KTPA brownfield
smelter expansion at our Aditya
facility in Odisha, with a planned
commissioning by FY 2027-28.

In line with our decarbonisation
roadmap, we have launcheda
comprehensive energy transition
initiative. Two pilot projects delivering
100 MW of round-the-clock (RTC)
renewable hybrid power for each
location is being implemented for

the Aditya & Mahan smelters and
expected to be commissioned

during FY 2025-26 and FY 2027-

28 respectively. On successful
implementation, this model shall be
replicated in our other smelters. For
facilitating bulk renewable power
import, the grid connectivity at these
units is being upgraded from 220 to
400 KV. Additional project for supply
of 200 MW of renewable RTC power

is being planned for Aditya smelter by
FY 2027-28. These initiatives shall help
us in advancing towards the company’s
aspiration to enhance share of
renewable to 30% in overall energy mix
by FY 2030-31 and thereby enhancing
share of low-carbon aluminium in

our portfolio.

To further enhance energy security
and reduce dependence on external
coal sources, we are developing two

large-scale captive coal mines in
Jharkhand and Odisha. The Chakla
coal mine in Jharkhand, with a capacity
of 4.5 million TPA, is expected to be
operational by FY 2025-26, while the
Meenakshi coal mine in Odisha, with
acapacity of about 12 million TPA,

is targeted for commissioning by

FY 2028-29. The mines shall playa
critical role in ensuring uninterrupted,
cost-effective energy supply for
Hindalco’s smelting operations,
supporting both operational
resilience and the company’s broader
sustainability goals.

Expansions at Copper
Upstream

To meet India’s rising demand for copper,
we are expanding our operations. A
major brownfield expansion at our
smelting complex in Dahej will add

300 KTPA capacity, increasing total
refined copper output to 721 KTPA.

With an investment of US$1.13 billion,
this expansion will make us the largest
single-location copper smelting complex
(outside China). This project is expected
to be commissioned by FY 2028-29.

Also in the works is India’s first integrated
copper and e-waste recycling facility which
will enable recovery of high-value metals
from electronic waste, supporting circular
economy goals. This facility, built on an
investment of US$290 million shall have an
initial capacity of 50 KTPA, scalable to 200
KTPA, and expected to be commissioned
by the first half of FY 2026-27.

The facility is being built at a time
when e-waste and non-ferrous metal
regulations in India are becoming
increasingly stringent, with the
government reinforcing Extended
Producer Responsibility (EPR)
norms and pushing for formalisation
of the recycling sector. By entering

a space traditionally dominated by
informal operators, we aim to set new
standards for compliance, safety, and
environmental stewardship. Apart
from supporting regulatory goals, the
facility will help transform the sector by
introducing advanced technologies,

creating environmentally focused jobs,
and positioning India as a global leader in
responsible e-waste management.

commitment to operational excellence
by strategically investing in the right
capabilities, expanding capacities and
benchmarking global best practices.
Through the adoption of modern
technologies, we aim to enhance
efficiency, reduce costs, and accelerate
the development of innovative,
sustainable products.

Our Core initiatives — World Class
Manufacturing (WCM), the Maintenance
Strategy and Execution Framework
(MSEF 2.0) for upstream operations,
and the Build Quality in Process

(BQiP) framework for downstream
quality — have already delivered
measurable improvements across

our operations. At Novelis, we drive
operational efficiency through the Novelis
Operating System (NOS), which is

built around key Centres of Excellence
(CoEs) such as Specific Improvement,
Operator Care, Planned Maintenance,
Progressive Quality, and Education

& Training. The operating system
provides a structured framework

for continuous improvement and
performance management.

To proactively manage risks, we leverage
our Enterprise Risk Management

(ERM) framework, which is integrated
into acompany-wide, multi-disciplinary
process. This framework enables us

to assess risks acrass short, medium,
and long-term horizons and guides the
identification and prioritisation of projects
that drive operational excellence.

Our management approach is designed
to systematically identify opportunities
that enhance the profitability of our
operations through:

+ Inorganic growth: Acquiring world-
class assets and technical capabilities
to meet rising global demand,
particularly in the automotive sector.

+ Organic growth: Investing in
debottlenecking, recycling, and
capacity expansion.

+ Product portfolio optimisation:
Focusing on high-potential segments
while exiting less attractive ones.

+ Talent development: Identifying top
talent and providing them with a range
of growth opportunities.

To engage employees and develop
problem-solving skills, we continue to
host Kaizen competitions across all

our plants and mines. This year, we
have achieved significant savings by
implementing 35,954 Kaizens and 2,542
continuous improvement projects.

Various other improvement opportunities
have also helped us to boost productivity
and efficiency at our plants. For instance,
introduction of HiPoT technology at the
Hirakud smelters have helped to improve
cell stability and reduce specific energy
consumption. Further, Aditya smelter has
set a benchmark by achieving Fe content
below 500 ppm in one-year average,
positioning it as one of the best smelters
globally in Fe content in Hot Metal.

32% this year.

Improving Reliability
through Streamwise
Maintenance
Assessments

As part of Hindalco's Engineering and
Maintenance Excellence initiative,

the “Stream-wise Maintenance
Assessment Framework” was launched
in January 2024. This was designed

to delve deeper into the quality of core
engineering, design, and maintenance
practices across the Mechanical, Electrical
& Instrumentation (E&1), and Civil &
Structural (C&S) streams. The primary
objective was to identify weaknesses,
uncover opportunities for improvement,
and drive standardisation across
aluminium upstream - smelters, power
plants, and refineries.

The framework focuses on seven
engineering areas: safety, adequacy of
engineering and maintenance checks,
implementation of engineering and
corrective actions, validation of equipment
care through equipment history, risk-
based maintenance strategies, spares
classification and preservation norms, and
the use of digital and predictive analytics.
These assessments are conducted
alongside the existing Maintenance
Strategy and Execution Framework
(MSEF), ensuring a holistic evaluation

of technical and systemic aspects of

plant operations.

Across-functional taskforce comprising
subject matter experts from various

plants conduct the assessments. This
collaborative approach provides deep
insights into improvement areas and fosters
cross-pollination of best practices across
plants. The initiative has already become a
regular practice, leading to the identification
of critical improvement areas that are
essential for stable and reliable operations.

InFY 2024-25, the assessments yielded
comprehensive insights into the current
condition of engineering practices,

based on which we have implemented
recommended actions, resulting in
improved equipment uptime and reliability.

Better Stability and Reliability at Aditya S Mahan through 400 KV Grid Connectivity

At Hindalco, the electricity
requirements of all our smelters are
met through our coal-based captive
power plants, connected via 220 and
132 KV transmission lines.

Uninterrupted power supply is critical
for aluminium smelting. However, due
to the long transmission distances,
both power plants experience multiple
instances of islanding during grid
disturbances. These disrupt stable
operations at smelters.

To enhance operational reliability, we
undertook projects to establish 400
KV grid connectivity.

This project is currently at various

stages of erection and commissioning:

+ Aditya Aluminium is being
connected to the 400 KV OPTCL
STU (State Transmission Utility)
Grid at Lapanga Substation,
with targeted commissioning in
FY 2025-26

+ Mahan Aluminium is being
connected to the 400 KV ISTS (Inter
State Transmission system) Grid
via a dedicated transmission line
with targeted commissioning by
FY 2027-28.

+ The 400 KV connectivity will
also enable the withdrawal
of uninterrupted round-the-
clock renewable energy from
offsite sources.

The specific energy consumption at
Aditya was reduced to 13.3 kwh/ kg
of Al from 13.5 kWh/ kg of Al, through
retrofitting copper insert collector

bar in cathode. To reduce energy
consumption further, the existing lining
design was modified to incorporate
new high insulation material, side

wall block shape changes and a new
version of copper on-sert collector

bar in place of insert which were
developed in collaboration with
ABSTC. Start-up laws and operational

procedures were also adjusted to
accommodate the newly designed
pot lining.

The modified pot lining has been
implemented in 17 test pots during
FY 2024-25. When compared to
pots of similar age with the previous
design, the new configuration
demonstrated a reduction in total pot
voltage by about 50 mV, translating
to an energy saving of 190 kwWh/T of
aluminium produced.

Energy Reduction Solutions through Design Modification of Cathodes at Aditya

Enhancing Alumina Recovery and Energy Efficiency at Muri

Muri refinery works on double digestion
for the extraction of alumina from
bauxite. The bauxite source of Muri
contains Boehmite or Mono Hydrate
Alumina whichis hard to digest and
requires a high temperature digestion
unit for recovery. We were able to

solve this through continuous process
improvements which resulted in higher
Overall Alumina Recovery, Precipitation
Liquor productivity and reduced specific
energy consumption.

Improvement of Overall
Alumina Recovery:

The overall recovery of any double
digestion plant lies in the range of
91-92%. The recovery part contains
2 major divisions - Chemical

Extraction and Post Digestion
recovery. We faced issues in
Chemical Extraction which was
solved by improving PDS Density,
Boehmite Reversion reduction,
Flocculant Dosing Philosophy change
and Granulometry trials. These
improvements led to an increase in
Overall Recovery from 90.6% to 91.8%
between FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25.
The level has sustained at 92.5-93%
since October 2024.

Benchmark efficiencies of
energy consumption:

The average energy customised
of Muri refinery used to be in the
range of 13-14 GJ/T in FY 2020-21
and FY 2021-22, with asteam

consumption of 3.2 T/T. We undertook
a series of steam reduction
debotilenecks, such as replacement
of heater tubes of LT and HT digestion,
2nd effect tube replacement

to improve evaporation steam
economy. We also reduced the size

of miscellaneous steam ring header
to cut process losses and installed an
SFT agitator. These measures have
resulted in reduction of steam up to
2.62 T/T in FY 2024-25.

Reduction of Steam Consumption at Renukoot Refinery

Renukoot Alumina Refinery is

one of the oldest refineries, using
various evaporation technologies
like Multistage Flash Evaporation,
Multistage Falling Film Evaporation
and Multistage Rising Film
Evaporation. In order to improve
steam economy of evaporation unit
and Condensate Heat Recovery, we
adopted an innovative approach,
achieving a reduction of overall steam
consumption per unit of alumina
produced, of plant from 3.042 T/T

to 2.543 T/T (16%) over a period of
seven years.

The refinery also initiated Condensate
Heat Recovery by unused
condensate routed through a heat
exchanger. This innovative approach
resulted ina significant reduction

in condensate temperature by
25-30°C, simultaneously elevating
the temperature of the vanadium lean

liquor by 25°C, Consequently, this led
to substantial savings in live steam
consumption and a notable decrease
in freshwater utilisation at the boiler end
as a higher proportion of condensate is
now utilised as DM feed water.

Acomprehensive analysis was carried
out to assess the drawbacks in existing
system and identify actionable points
to attain our objective.

Methodologies adopted were process
reengineering, adopting statistical
tools and data analytics, refinement

in process control and improved
operational practices. Steam economy
of evaporation units improved from
2.65 T/T against 3.63 T/T earlier.

Improved Dust Control System to Enhance Copper Wire Drawing Performance

Copper wire rods are widely used in
electrical and industrial applications
because of their excellent conductivity
and durability. However, during
production and downstream
processes like wire drawing, fine
copper dust is generated, which can
cause surface defects, reduce coating
quality, and lead to material loss.

Investigations using advanced
techniques like XRF and XRD showed
that this dust consists primarily

of elemental copper with traces

of cuprous oxide. These particles

entered the emulsion, affecting
quality. The root cause was identified
as rough patches formed during the
hot rolling process, which released
fine particles into the emulsion used
in manufacturing. These particles
were then carried forward into the
final product, affecting its quality

and performance.

To solve this issue, a customised
dual-stage filtration system was
developed. This system is designed
to remove particles smaller than 100
microns and includes independently

operating units with high-capacity
pumps that adjust based on dust
levels. The filtration system effectively
cleans the emulsion, preventing dust
from re-entering the copper rod.

The system led to enhanced
operational efficiency with improved
product quality and process
cleanliness. The system reduced
significant amount of dust during
rod and wire drawing operations at
customer sites, enhancing overall
customer satisfaction.

Accelerating Hard Alloy
Production in Alupuram

To enhance operational efficiency
and market competitiveness,
Hindalco’s Alupuram unit
launched a focused initiative to
improve hard alloy casting and
extrusions capabilities. The alloys
serve high-demand sectors like
aerospace and defence. There
were challenges such as billet
cracking and low productivity,
which were addressed through a
series of interventions.

A data-driven approach revealed
the potential reasons for billet
cracks and prompted adjustments
in alloy composition, changes in
casting parameters, cooling rates,
and grain refinement leading to
improved productivity and recovery
of extrusions.

This project led to nearly 4x
increase in production over the
4 years, increased EBITDA,
and substantially improved

pit recovery for AA7075.
Beyond financial gains, the
initiative supported market
expansion and fostered
cross-functional collaboration

Stabilisation of Wider-width Litho at Hirakud FRP

To reduce the dependency on
imports, we decided to boost

the production volume of
lithographic aluminium sheet (litho)
at Taloja. Teams from marketing,
planning, production, and quality
from Taloja and Hirakud plants
collaborated on this project to
enhance supplies. The focus

was on metal planning to meet

litho production targets. Spares
management and prioritising issues
helped in increasing reliability of
the operations. Dashboards were
developed to monitor recovery and
turnaround time (TAT) which helped
the Taloja team to track key KPIs.

These initiatives helped us to achieve
increased line speeds from 150 to 195
MPM by resolving equipment issues and
boosting operator confidence. Using
the DMAIC approach, the TAT was
improved, moreover, cross-functional
teams conducted Pareto analysis on
coil breaks. The digital monitoring and
Pareto analysis helped improve litho
recovery in terms of length and width.

The efforts ramped up volume from
15.9KT in FY 2023-24 to 17.6 KT in
FY 2024-25, improved recovery by
1.1%, and increased utilisation from
76% to 83%, resulting inan EBITDA
improvement of 74.5 crore per annum.

Cold Rolling Mill Productivity Enhancement at Mouda

To meet the demand for foil catering to
pharma and food segments, Mouda
used to source >200 TPM of Cold Rolled
Coil (CRC) from Hirakud FRP which
was ata higher cost than inhouse CRC.
To enhance the capacity of in-house
CRC at Mouda, ateam comprising
members from production, process,
engineering, and operations initiated

a project. The project focused on
improving productivity, reducing quality
rejections, and increasing equipment
reliability. Kaizen events and problem-

solving approaches like RCA and DPS
were utilised to implement systematic

action plans through MOC, DOE trials
and HIRA.

The project reduced turnaround time
from 7 to 4.6 minutes, increased
production tonnage per hour by
reducing errors and boosted mill speed
from 455 to 489 MPM. Eliminating black
line and pit/skid mark issues through
process standardisation improved the
quality performance. Reliability was

improved by reducing the unplanned
downtime via a preventive maintenance
plan and root cause analysis.

The efforts resulted in an annual
production gain of 2.6 KT, resulting in
financial benefits of 20 crore due to
improvement in mill utilsation, increasing
monthly passes, and reduction in power
consumption per tonne.

Reducing Energy
Consumption in Soaking
Pit at Renukoot FRP

To reduce energy costs in the

Hot Mill and FRP operations

at Renukoot, we undertook a
revamp of the Soaking Pit. This pit,
essential for preheating aluminium
slabs before hot rolling, was
consuming excessive power. The
revamp project aimed to achieve
arecurring energy saving of 125
kwh/ MT.

The project involved a detailed
energy consumption study,
optimisation of heater banks,

and replacement of edge-wound
heaters with more efficient bundled
heaters. We also upgraded the
outdated contactor control system
to athyristor power controller

for better energy regulation.

An automatic fire suppression
system was also installed to
enhance safety.

The project helped to reduce
energy consumption, improve
equipment reliability, and made
operation easier through an
integrated SCADA interface.

Product Development
at Renukoot Extrusions
for Automotive Parts
Manufacturer

Renukoot successfully qualified

its AA6061 HS alloy for a leading
automotive parts manufacturer,
through a rigorous end-to-end
process. This included ensuring
billet quality from both Renukoot
casting stations using microstructure
analysis and manual ultrasonic
testing (UST). Multiple extrusion trials
were conducted to meet stringent
mechanical property requirements,
followed by a successful

Production Part Approval Process
(PPAP) submission.

Inthe machine shop, 100% UST,
hardness testing, and dimensional
checks were carried out, with laser
marking introduced for full traceability
from casting to packaging.

This initiative not only led to the
alloy’s successful adoption by the
customer but also enabled a major
production ramp-up. Component
supply increased from 1,803 units
in September 2024 to 147,061 units
by March 2025 while meeting global

automotive standards.
a

Optimisation at Taloja

High rate of coating defects in coils
was found to be a major contributor to
Non-Conformities (NCs) at the Taloja
plant. A process improvement initiative
was taken up at Soaking Pit operations
to solve the problem.

The plant team optimised the emulsion
oil mix used in the hot mill to add HIC
and Houghton oils in the same ratio,
vis-a-vis maintaining a 70:30 ratio
earlier. The revised approach was

Reducing Coating Defect NCs through Emulsion

supported by SCADA logic for operator
ease while PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act)
approach was used to monitor alloy-
wise results.

Because of the optimised oil
mix, coating defect NCs reduced
from 1.71% to 0.61% leading to
improvements in surface quality,
operational consistency and
financial savings.

Process
digitalisation

Digitalisation: Higher
Efficiency, Performance,
Transparency

In FY 2024-25, Hindalco accelerated
its digital transformation journey,
embedding advanced technologies
across the value chain to drive
operational excellence, sustainability,
and customer-centricity. We
implemented numerous digital
initiatives leveraging Al, ML, IloT,
Digital Twins, blockchain, and
augmented reality to transform how
we operate, monitor, and deliver.

In manufacturing, digital twins have
been deployed at the Hirakud and
Aditya power plants and the Green
Anode Plant at Mahan, enabling
real-time process optimisation and
improving energy efficiency. Further,
Al/ ML-driven analytics projects, such
as yield optimisation at Renukoct,
particle size distribution prediction in
Specialty Alumina plants, and pinhole
detection at Mouda, have significantly
boosted process outcomes and
product quality. We are also putting in
place Operations Data Management
platform in 12 upstream plants

to aggregate dispersed data and
visualise KPIs for faster decision-
making on the shopfloor.

In safety and quality inspection,
computer vision-based video
analytics are being used for coal sieve
analysis at Hirakud, cathode quality
at the copper operations in Dahej, and
switchyard safety at Renusagar and
Aditya. Over 70 AR/ VR (Augumented
Reality & Virtual Reality) models are
deployed for operator training and
safety enhancement. In logistics, our
Logistics Insight Tower (LIT) 2.0, smart
warehouse systems and blockchain-
based toller management system

Power plant em

at Taloja are enabling real-time
tracking, inventory visibility, and
improved reconciliation.

We have also made significant
strides in predictive maintenance.
Over 400 critical assets have been
integrated with Al/ML-based asset
performance models, improving
uptime and Mean Time Between
Failures (MTBF). Additionally, 300+
heavy earth-moving machines have
been digitally enabled, leading to
better utilisation and fuel efficiency.
These tools are enhancing reliability
and contributing towards our Net
Zero goals by reducing energy use
and extending asset life. Further, we
are leveraging Gen-Al technology in
multiple use cases such as getting
market insights, operations insights,
and legal assistance.

To support this transformation,

we have invested in building

digital capabilities across the
organisation. Through DISHA
(Digital Shiksha) programme, over
3,500 employees have been trained
in digital technologies and analytics
tools. More than 650 shop floor
employees have received 500+
hours of analytics training. Through
our Citizen Data Scientist initiative
we have trained 17 engineers in
data science who have delivered
10+ high-impact projects, with 15
more underway.

arpen their
skills through real-time simulation training

Our digital roadmap is anchored

in four strategic pillars: Smart
Manufacturing, Smart Supply Chain,
Customer Centricity, and Smart
Workplace. These are supported

by arobust IT and data foundation,
including enterprise-wide data lakes,
cloud-based ERP (Ekaayan), in
addition to a stronger IT & OT security
posture and madernised network
infrastructure. We have also adopted
tools aligned with our ESG goals,
suchas energy monitoring systems,
predictive maintenance platforms,
and digital dashboards to track
sustainability KPls.

As we scale our Industry 4.0 journey,
we continue to collaborate with
startups and technology partners

to bring innovations like blockchain,
computer vision, and Gen-Al into our
operations. Our Connected Plant
programme and Plant of the Future
framework are already delivering
measurable business impact,
reinforcing our commitment to build
a future-ready Hindalco.

Lithographic Sheets
Ramp-up at Taloja

In response to the rising domestic
demand for wider width Litho coils,
Hirakud FRP undertook a product
stabilisation initiative for such Litho
offerings. The objective was to
develop high-strength Litho sheets
with stringent flatness and surface
finish tolerances, critical for consistent
and high-quality printing applications.

As this marked the plant's first foray
into Litho product manufacturing,
initial challenges included surface
defects, waviness, scoring marks,
and flatness variability -- primarily
due to differences in mill capabilities
and specifications.

The Hirakud and Taloja teams worked
closely together to solve the issues.
They identified the root causes,
optimised machine parameters,
introduced targeted training
programmes, and introduced process
innovations to meet the required
quality standards.

This initiative delivered significant
improvements in product quality,
enhanced productivity, and reduced
turnaround times. Financially, it
contributed to increase in EBITDA, while
also elevating customer satisfaction and
reinforcing the Company's leadership in
the domestic Litho market.

Data Management
Platform Launched for
Upstream Plants

Hindalco launched a centralised Data
Management Platform

(DMP) initiative, with the objective of
accelerating digital transformation
across its upstream operations.

The platform integrates real-time
data from aluminium smelters,
power plants, alumina refineries,
and copper to enable data-driven
decision-making and improve
operational efficiency.

The DMP consolidates various

digital initiatives such as IloT-

based condition monitoring, drone
surveillance, and predictive analytics,
into a unified system. It supports real-
time tracking, advanced analytics
and seamless integration with ERP
systems. The rolloutis planned in
two phases, with Phase 1 covering
Hirakud, Muri, Aditya, Mahan, Utkal
and copper operations in Dahej,

and Phase 2 covering Renukoot

and Renusagar.

implementation has shown
measurable improvements in
efficiency and energy use. Once
fully deployed, the DMP will serve as
the digital backbone of Hindalco's
“Plant of the Future,” aligning with its
Industry 4.0 goals.

Leveraging Digital
Twin for Operational
Efficiency

At Hindalco, we are leveraging
Digital Twin technology to optimise
performance and energy efficiency
across Critical operations. At our
Hirakud and Aditya power plants,
Digital Twin are helping improve
plant heat rate through boiler
performance optimisation and asset
performance monitoring. To optimise
boiler performance under varied
operating conditions and fuel quality,
we connected over 100 assets and
deployed more than 200 analytics
models. These improvements

have reduced ignition loss, specific
steam consumption and boosted
asset reliability.

Similarly, at the Green Anode

Plant in Mahan, the Digital Twin is
improving anode quality and reducing
rejections. Real-time prediction

of raw material quality, recipe
optimisation, and KPI tracking have
resulted in 78% of recommended
actions. Improvements have

been observed across seven

KPIs, including reduced energy
consumption at the smelter.

Smart infrastructure for smart power plant operations

Using Time Study to
Improve Cold Rolling Mill
Productivity in Taloja

To meet the growing market demand
for high value aluminium FRP
products like CLAD, fin stock, and
automotive applications, we needed
to improve mill productivity and
eliminate MUDA (waste).

Improvement in mill productivity

shall increase plant capacity,

reduce power consumption,
enhance equipment efficiency,

and boost EBITDA. Mill availability
was identified as a constraint to
productivity due to downtime and
extended mill turn-around time (TAT).
We leveraged IIOT platform and
improved the productivity by breaking
down TAT into micro-processes,
conducting time studies, and holding
Kaizen events with mill workers. This
loT module made data access easy
at the shop floor and enabled daily
discussions with crew members to
share best practices.

Extensive digitalisation helped

to enhance mill operations. Field
sensors were installed to monitor
29 micro-processes and several
modifications were made. These
include automating manual
operations using computer vision
improving buggy speed, optimising
uncoiler and coiler operations

and maintaining hydraulic circuits
for quick response. These efforts
reduced the average TAT from

3.83 minutes in FY 2020-21 to 2.92
minutes in FY 2024-25, increased mill
availability by 72 hours per month,
thus improving productivity by 540
MT per month.

In addition, we achieved the lowest
TAT of 2.72 minutes per coil, the
highest pass of 5,582 ina month, and
the lowest power consumption of 123
kWh per pass. These measures have
improved operational efficiency and
cost savings.

Novelis' innovation journey is supported by its network of 11 R&D centres

Blockchains Enabling
Tolling Management
System at Taloja

We faced multiple challenges

due to manual management of
tolling systems at Taloja. There

were instances where information
required for audit was missing or
unreliable. To overcome this problem,
we successfully digitalised the
Tolling Process using blockchain
technology to streamline interactions
with job workers and enhance
operational transparency.

The solution digitised the Master
Service Order (MSO) and Quality
Clearance workflows. It integrated
seamlessly with our ERP system
and provided a comprehensive
dashboard for real-time visibility

of MSO status and inventory

at toller sites. The initiative
enabled accurate reconciliation

of finished goods, scrap, and
packing materials. With built-in
validation workflows, audit trails,
and automated checks, the system
minimised data entry errors and led
to better decision-making. Going
forward, this initiative shall save
packing material, improve tracking
of work-in-progress and finished
goods, thus enabling transparent
tolling operations.

Predictive Maintenance
Transformation at
Pinda, Novelis

The Pinda facility implemented a
cutting-edge predictive maintenance
solution to enhance equipment
reliability and operational efficiency, as
part of Novelis’s “Plant of the Future”
initiative. The project involved the
installation of over 700 loT sensors

on the Hot Mill, which were integrated
with an advanced Asset Performance
Management (APM) system. This
system leverages artificial intelligence
and machine learning to monitor
equipment health in real time, detect
anomalies, and predict potential
failures before they occur.

The APM solution is built ona

hybrid architecture combining cloud
scalability with edge computing for
low-latency data processing. This
solution enables the plant to move from
reactive to predictive, and eventually
prescriptive maintenance, where

the system forecasts issues and
recommends corrective actions. As
aresult, the Pinda plant has achieved
a significant reduction in unplanned
downtime, improved maintenance
planning, and optimised resource
utilisation. This initiative has become
abenchmark for digital reliability
practices across operations.

Operational Excellence
Diagnostic at Ulsan,
Novelis

The Ulsan facility undertook a
comprehensive Operational
Excellence Diagnostic to align its
performance with our strategic goals
and the principles of the Novelis
Operating System (NOS). This
diagnostic was designed to assess
the plant’s current capabilities,
identify improvement opportunities,
and build a roadmap for sustainable
performance enhancement.

The initiative focused on foundational
NOS practices: defining purpose

and strategy based on customer
value, setting measurable targets,
identifying and analysing operational
losses, aligning improvement efforts
toaunified agenda, and executing
structured problem-solving. Through
this initiative, the Ulsan team identified
several key levers to improve Cold Mill
throughput by FY 2026-27.

Despite increased quality inspection
requirements, the plant successfully
enhanced productivity and
significantly reduced its overall claim
rate. The diagnostic delivered tangible
operational gains and strengthened
the plant’s alignment with the

broader “Novelis Way” of continuous
improvement and excellence.

Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment

and Incident Investigation

Our proactive and structured approach to
risk identification is anchored by Hazard
Identification and Risk Assessment
(HIRA) framework and Job Safety
Analysis (JSA) processes. These

are systematically applied before the
commencement of any activity, routine or
non-routine to evaluate potential hazards
and determine the associated risk levels.

We involve line managers, safety
officers, and contractor representatives
in workplace risk assessments and
working conditions as this fosters a
shared responsibility for safety and
working conditions and ensures that
frontline insights are incorporated. All
the people involved in hazard and risk
assessments are trained and deemed
competent as per internal standards and
regulatory requirements.

To identify, investigate, and monitor our
safety performance and ensure timely
mitigation of risks, we use digital tools and
technologies. These include ENABLON,
Contractor Safety Management module
(CSM), safety audit, e-Permit, e-MOC,

Taproot® incident investigation software,
etc. We utilise Taproot® incident
investigation software to systematically
identify root causes for high-severity
incidents. The process involves detailed
fact-finding to assess associated hazards
and risks, followed by the implementation
of corrective and preventive actions
based on the Hierarchy of Controls

— Elimination, Substitution, Isolation,
Engineering Control, Administrative
Control, and Personal Protective
Equipment, in the order of importance.
To quantify risk levels and support
consistent decision-making, we use
astandardised 5x65 risk matrix that
evaluates the likelinood and severity of
potential outcomes. This prioritises risks
based on their potential impact and the
probability of occurrence, ensuring that
resources are directed toward the most
significant hazards.

Following any incident, a Preliminary
Incident Report (PIR) is prepared with the
date, time, location, incident description,
and immediate actions taken. This report
is shared via email with stakeholders

ities Kelp dur teams to map

risks and test readiness thus equipping them to respond swiftly during emergencies

as per the approved distribution list.
Based on the severity of the incident, a
cross-functional team may be formed to
investigate contributing factors, assess
relevant elements of the Process Safety
Management (PSM) System, and
recommend corrective and preventive
actions. After review and approval,

key learnings are documented and
communicated across the organisation
to support continuous improvement and
reinforce a strong safety culture.

We use remote crawler technology

to monitor tank thickness, and Al
cameras for real-time hotspot detection
in switchyards. Moreover, we have
enhanced confined space safety by
enabling gas monitoring through Rapid
Deployment Units, which ensures
continuous monitoring of the atmosphere
and detects hazardous gases. To
strengthen transportation safety, driver
fatigue management systems have been
installed across all vehicles that detect
and mitigate fatigue-related risks.

Journey Risk
Management

At Hindalco, we have introduced the
Journey Risk Management (JRM)
initiative to ensure the safety of our
employees during official travel
across units and mines. The goal
was to identify risks such as road
hazards, weather conditions, and
health concerns.

Before each journey, we provide
users with information on

weather forecasts, road safety
guidelines, emergency contacts,
and interactive route maps. Our
drivers log into the JRM app before
starting their trip, enabling real-time
speed monitoring and voice alerts
for hazards like speed breakers,
sharp turns, and potholes. To
prevent fatigue, the app prompts
drivers to take breaks every two
hours. Throughout the journey, the
app tracks driving behaviour and
vehicle performance.

We reinforce the effectiveness of our
OHS system through periodic internal
and external audits, and cross-
functional reviews. We have a dedicated
team which carries out internal audits,
led by business heads or cluster heads.
The audit has three levels: Level 1

audit (self-assessment audit by facility,
area, and department), Level 2 audit
(cross-functional audit conducted
through subject matter experts), and
Level 3 audit (organised by corporate
safety team, Subject matter expert from
different units and led by business/
cluster heads). Insights from incident
investigations, near-miss reports, and
safety observations is integrated into
our processes, enabling continuous
updates to risk registers, procedures,
and controls. Additionally, the Executive
Committee (ExCom) dedicates five
in-person days annually to conduct
internal safety audits, underscoring
leadership commitment to a safe and
compliant work environment.

We have a comprehensive emergency
plan in place for all our manufacturing
plants, mines, and offices. It outlines
potential emergency scenarios

and includes regular mock drills
involving employees, workmen, and
senior leaders. In addition, our crisis
management plan addresses broader
safety issues beyond immediate
emergencies. Safety risks are also
integrated into our enterprise risk
management framework, and we have
a Business Continuity Management
(BCM) plan to ensure preparedness
and resilience.

During the reporting period, 100% of
our plants and offices were assessed
on health and safety requirements

and working conditions. Moreover, we
embed Occupational Health and Safety
(OHS) criteria into supplier selection
and ongoing performance evaluations
to minimise risks throughout the value
chain and ensure a safe and compliant
working environment. Further details
on supplier assessment on various
parameters including health and safety
and working conditions can be found in
Social and Relationship Capital.

At Novelis, our commitment to
workplace safety extends beyond
compliance with ISO 45001 standards.
Allsites are mandated to adhere to

the Novelis Risk Profile Directive and
are required to develop and implement
formal procedures for conducting

risk assessments.

This includes:

+ Usea standardised risk matrix to
assess risks based on probability
and severity

+ Evaluate risks at various
stages - without controls; with
existing controls; with proposed
additional controls

+ Take countermeasures in accordance
with the Hierarchy of Controls

+ Rank individual risks to prioritise
mitigation efforts

+ Compile a plant-wide list of top risks
to ensure visibility and focus on the
most critical safety concerns

Additionally, Novelis has established
acomprehensive Environmental,
Health, and Safety (EHS) Incident
Management Performance Standard,
which is mandatory for implementation
across all operational sites. This
standard provides a clear and systematic
framework for conducting accident
investigations, ensuring accountability,
and driving continuous improvement in
safety performance.

At Novelis, we conduct three types

of audits at our facilities: regulatory
compliance audits, shop floor condition
audits, and audits based on our internal
standards. These are carried out by

our global and regional teams, as well
as external consultants. Moreover,
sites with ISO certifications undergo
regular certification and surveillance
audits to maintain compliance and
performance standards.

The workday begins with a toolbox talk to assess the e
understand the risks, and follow all safety protocols.

Grievance Redressal Mechanism

At Hindalco, employees and workers
are encouraged to identify and report
potential and actual work-related
hazards through our online platform,
Enablon. This system ensures that all
unsafe acts and unsafe conditions are
logged, tracked, and addressed timely.
We have institutionalised a reward

and recognition policy to acknowledge
and reward employees who report
near misses, best Behaviour Based
Safety Observation (BBSO), safety
interventions, in-line of fire reporting,
unsafe acts and unsafe conditions.
We also recognise best safety practice

implementations by subject matter
experts and task forces in forums such
as Annual Safety meet.

We ensure that no reprisals or punitive
actions are taken against workers for
reporting hazards or safety concerns
in good faith. Workers have the right
to remove themselves from any work
situation they believe could cause
injury or ill health. During FY 2024-25,
we received zero complaints from
employees and workers on health and
safety and working conditions at our
Hindalco India.

Details of safety performance during FY 2024-25: Global Operations

At Novelis, all facility incidents

are reported through a dedicated
reporting tool. Employees can also
raise concerns or complaints via the
Novelis Ethics Hotline, with the option
to remain anonymous. Each report
generates a unique tracking number,
allowing employees to check the status
of their submission. All employees
are granted Stop Work authority,
empowering them to immediately halt
any task or operation upon identifying
asafety concern.

Occupational Health
Services

At Hindalco, we are committed to ensuring
the health and well-being of our employees
through a comprehensive framework of
occupational and non-occupational health
services. Our approach integrates rigorous
risk assessments, wellness programmes,
and strong data privacy practices to foster
asafe and supportive work environment.
We leverage PEHEL software to monitor
employee pre-medical checkup data and
risk zone classification.

Guided by the International Labour
Organisation’s (ILO) Convention 161, we
conduct rigorous Qualitative Exposure
Assessments (QIEA) and Quantitative
Exposure Assessments (QnEA) to identify
potential hazards affecting the physical
and mental well-being of our employees.
Building on the insights gleaned from these
assessments, we identified work-related
hazards that pose a risk of ill health which
includes exposure to dust, noise, heat
stress, ergonomic strain, and chemicals.

To ensure quality and accessibility

of occupational health services, we
operate onsite Occupational Health
Centres staffed with qualified medical
professionals. We also allow workload
adjustments for employees to attend
medical check-ups, provide transportation
and priority access to external clinics
when required.

Beyond occupational health, we facilitate
access to non-occupational medical and
healthcare services through a combination
of onsite and offsite provisions. All

major plant locations are equipped with
primary healthcare centres that offer
services beyond workplace-related

care. Ourinclusive health ecosystem
includes multi-specialty hospitals,
outpatient departments (OPDs), and

dedicated ambulances, offering maternity
care, MRI, transplant procedures, and
occupational therapy. We also conduct
regular preventive health camps, blood
donation drives, and nutrition awareness
programmes to promote proactive

health management.

In addition, we offer a wide range of
voluntary health promotion programmes
aimed at addressing non-work-related
health risks. These initiatives focus

on cardiovascular health, diabetes
management, tobacco cessation, mental
health awareness, stress management,
psychological support, nutrition, and
physical fitness. Access to these
services is facilitated through onsite
health camps, wellness workshops,
counselling sessions, and regular health
screenings. Educational materials are
provided in local languages, and activities
are integrated into work schedules to
encourage participation.

At Novelis, employees are covered by
comprehensive medical insurance and
have access to public healthcare services.
The Company also offers voluntary health
programmes such as preventive care
screenings, biometric assessments, and
wellness events focused on healthy habits,
back care, nutrition, and fertility services.

Both Hindalco and Novelis uphold

the highest standards of data privacy.
Personal health information is handled
with strict confidentiality and is accessible
only to authorised medical professionals.
All health data is managed in compliance
with applicable data protection laws,

and participation in health programmes

is entirely voluntary, with no impact on
employment decisions. This ensures a.
culture of trust and openness, encouraging
employees to engage fully in health and
wellness initiatives.

Health and Safety
Training and Awareness

At Hindalco, we proactively identify training
needs based on job roles, skill levels,
jobhazard analyses, incident reports,
operational changes, employee feedback,
audits, and regulatory updates. Each of our
plants prepares a monthly training plan to
address these needs.

We ensure that all employees and
workers receive safety training before
initiating on-site duties. Each employee
completes a minimum of three man-
days of training annually, and we deliver
sessions in regional languages to ensure
clear understanding. Our workforce is
supported by more than 4 to 5 subject
matter experts for every safety standard.
The SMEs have received trainings through
both internal and external programmes.

At Novelis, our training programmes are
developed in alignment with corporate
policies, legal obligations, and site-
specific requirements. Training topics
include critical areas such as machine
guarding, hazardous energy control,
mobile equipment operation, and electrical
safety. We deliver training through a variety
of methods, including classroom sessions,
hands-on practical exercises, virtual reality
simulations, and web-based modules. Our
web-based training is facilitated through
the ABG Cornerstone portal. During the
reporting year, we introduced Safety Hour
at all plants, where plant leaders dedicate
one hour on the shop floor to identify

and address safety risks through direct
observation and meaningful engagement
with employees.

To ensure effectiveness, we conduct
post-training assessments to evaluate
knowledge retention and understanding.

Human Capital
Development

At Hindalco, we focus on holistic
development of our workforce to
meet evolving business needs.
A World of Opportunities is a key
element of our employee value
proposition, which ensures that
each employee has access to

all relevant learning and career
growth opportunities along with
exciting rewards, recognition
and enabling work environment
during their employment journey
with us.

Our learning and development efforts are
aligned with strategic business priorities
and future capability needs to ensure

our workforce is equipped for emerging
challenges. Guided by the 70-20-10
learning principles, we believe that 70%
of learning happens through on-the-job
experiences, 20% through mentoring-
coaching and peer interactions, and 10%
through formal training. This approach
fosters continuous learning and real-
world readiness.

We follow a learner-centric and role-based
approach to people development to ensure
relevance and impact across different levels
and business needs. Learning journeys
are tailored to empower employees at
every career stage, combining functional
and behavioural development through
both internal and external interventions.
Our approach to identifying the training
needs of employees includes competency
assessments via COMPASS reports,
career aspiration discussions, 360-degree
feedback, DAC reports, Talent Councils,
specialist career paths, and inputs from
discussions between managers and
employees, HRBPs, and business leaders.

Throughout the process, we provide
employees a clear view of strengths and
areas for improvement, forming the basis
of a personalised My Development Plan
(MDP). The MDP enables targeted skill
development and helps track progress
throughout the year, ensuring continuous
learning aligned with both personal and
business goals.

We have dedicated functional academies
for Sales and Marketing, Procurement
and Finance, etc., which support
domain-specific growth, while external
collaborations such as with IIMM for
Strategic Procurement, IITs and BITS

Our people are the engines driving the organisation's growth

for technical areas, IIMs for management
development, institutes run by Education
Management Organisations (EOMs), etc.
enhance learning depth. We prioritise
future capability building in leadership,
digital, functional, and behavioural areas
through partnerships with Hindalco
Technical University (HTU) and the Digital
Capability Building Team. Our digital-
first ecosystem, powered by CSOD and
Coursera, enables scalable, accessible,
and continuous learning.

Over the past year, we have focused on
leveraging internal resources including
Aditya Birla Group’s global learning centre,
Gyanodaya for leadership development
programmes. We leverage Coursera

to encourage self-paced learning and
integrating it with journey programmes (for
instance: XSEED, FLY). We have increased
our focus on building internal trainer
capacity and involving senior leaders

in programme design and delivery. In
alignment with this, we introduced Leader
in Residence (LIR), wherein we invite
leaders to build the content and share their
experiences and expectations.

Acculture of continuous learning

is embedded through our culture
transformation programme Shillim’s
ALERT behaviours, promoting curiosity,
experimentation, and feedback as part of
everyday work.

Key training programmes

Our training programmes are tailored

to the needs of individuals, cohorts and
teams. These learning interventions
are anchored around five core areas:
Competency building (behavioural and
functional), Leadership development
programmes, Coaching culture,
Technical capability building through
Hindalco Technical University, and
Digital transformation. We have
increased our focus on imparting digital
and virtual trainings and at the same
time we continue to deliver physical
training programmes. Our relentless
focus on employee development can be
reflected through the increased number
of training hours provided during the
reporting period.

Technical Capability
Building - Hindalco
Technical University

Since its inception in 2017, Hindalco
Technical University (HTU) has been
our dedicated platform for building and
strengthening the technical capabilities
of our workforce across plants and
mines. We've focused on equipping
our teams in core manufacturing

and maintenance roles through a
combination of online and offline
training programmes, technical events,
and expert-led forums.

We structure our programmes at three
key levels: plant-specific, business-wide,
and central thematic offerings such as
Six Sigma, Project Management, and
Reliability. To cater to the unique needs
of our diverse operations, we have
established HTU Schools for Smelter,
Refinery, Power, Mining, Copper, and
Maintenance. Each school is guided

by an operating committee of unit
representatives to ensure our training
remains practical, relevant, differentiated
and aligned with industry best practices.

In FY 2024-25 alone, we delivered

over 221 onsite and online technical
programmes through HTU, impacting
more than 12,447 employees in
technical roles. These sessions were
led by our internal subject matter
experts and external specialists,
including OEMs. Some of the highlights
of our major initiatives are as below:

Measuring the
Effectiveness of Training

At Hindalco, we employ the
Kirkpatrick Model to thoroughly
assess the effectiveness of our
training programmes. We measure
outcomes across four key areas:
Reaction, Learning, Behaviour, and
Results. During the year, we assessed
our training programme outcomes
and scope of improvement were
incorporated, basis the feedback. For
DNA interventions XSEED and FLY,
we have received training feedback
scores 4.7 and 4.6 respectively, ona
5-point scale.

External Associations and
Accreditation

To better equip our new management
level employees, we have collaborated
with external educational partners and
institutions such as Manipal GlobalNxt
University, IIM Sambalpur, Systems
and Networks Technologies Training
Institute (SNTI), Nettur Technical
Training Foundation (NTTF), ABP,
Siemens, National Power Training
Institute (NPTI), Central Tool Room and
Training Centre (CTTC}, BHEL, and
BITS Pilani.

During the year, we collaborated

with the Indian Institute of Materials
Management (IIMM) to design a
structured 5-day training workshop
tailored to our specific requirements for
our strategic procurement intervention.
The objective of the programme

was to introduce key procurement
concepts, best practices, and strategic
frameworks, ensuring that participants
gain acomprehensive understanding
of procurement’s role in business
operations. 40 new joiners, were
trained, conducting sessions in two
batches of 20 participants each.

We also analyse the qualitative feedback shared by the participants and their
managers. Few testimonials are shared below:

Diversity, Equity and
Inclusion

Our DEI vision statement “Let
us forge a powerful alliance

to shape a workplace culture
that thrives on inclusivity,
equity, and diversity, propelling
both individual and business
growth”, acts as a guiding light.

At Hindalco, we are committed to
fostering a workplace where diversity

is not only respected but celebrated.
Creating a safe, inclusive, and equitable
environment for women is a key priority at
Hindalco. Guided by our Code of Conduct
and Corporate Principles, we uphold a
strict zero-tolerance policy for all forms

of harassment. Our Prevention of Sexual
Harassment (POSH) policy ensures the
safeguarding of employees througha
fair, confidential, and impartial grievance
tedressal mechanism.

Our policies are designed to go beyond
compliance, actively promoting fairness,
safety, and support. Our Dual Career
policy, Flexible travel policy (wherein
mothers can take their child and caregiver
on official visits) as well as Flexi-time and
work-from-home arrangements promote
work-life balance. Creche facilities with
third-party partners at regional and
corporate offices and reimbursement to
those availing creche benefits providing
further support to returning mothers.

At Novelis, our commitment to diversity
and inclusion is driven by a multi-tiered
governance structure. Our global
Diversity and Inclusion (D&1) board,
chaired by the CEO and supported by
executive leaders, sets the strategic
direction for advancing diversity
across the organisation. Regional D&1
councils, led by respective regional
presidents, adapt this strategy to local
contexts, ensuring cultural relevance
and impact. These councils also support
local Employee Resource Groups
(ERGs), which serve as dynamic
platforms for employees to connect,
share experiences, and build asense
of belonging.

Women represent 9.37% of STEM positions in Hindalco India

Culture of Inclusion- Employee Resource Groups

In our commitment to creating an
inclusive environment where every
individual can bring their unique selves
and thrive, we have established a
Women’s Employee Resource Group
(W-ERG). W-ERG is a cohort of women
from mid to senior levels offering their
expertise and support to women across
Hindalco. In this initiative, mentees

are given opportunities to network,
have career conversations, and build
skills. The group also actively works on
creating awareness on woman support
programmes and internal policies. We
are strengthening the functioning of
our W-ERG by building capabilities

of its members and defining common
success metrics to evaluate the
effectiveness of the groups.

At Novelis, we support a diverse
network of ERGs that reflect the unique
identities and experiences of our
global workforce. In North America,
employees engage through BREATHE,
jHOLA!, MISSION, and Novelis Next.
South America is represented by
IGuAl, while PROUD spans Europe,
North America, and South America
connecting LGBTQIA2S+ employees
and allies to create pathways for

belonging. Our global ERG, WIN
(Women in Novelis), empowers women
across all regions.

Women in Night Shifts:
— Empowering Equality
while Ensuring Safety

In 2023, we took a bold and
progressive step towards
building a more inclusive and
equitable workplace by launching
the Women in Night Shift (WINS)
initiative. The first-of-its-kind
programme was piloted in

the Odisha cluster, aiming to
challenge traditional gender
roles and create opportunities for
women to participate fully in all
the shifts. The initiative was later
extended to Aditya FRP unit.

We assigned Night Duty Officers
(NDOs) to oversee night
operations and serve as a point of
contact for women working during
those shifts. Additionally, we
hired six female security guards,
and three female medical staffs
at Hirakud FRP. We implemented
robust safety protocols, ensuring
that our facilities were secure

and responsive to the needs

of our women employees

working during night shifts. We
also introduced door-to-door
transportation, with vehicles
equipped with GPS trackers to
ensure real-time monitoring and
safe commutes.

This resulted in increased
gender participation anda
significant cultural shift, breaking
stereotypes and enhanced
operational performance. The
initiative also led to improved
confidence and morale among
our employees.

PRADNYA CHAVAN

GET batch 23

“We were advised that young managers should
gradually transition from day shifts to night shifts
to help our bodies adjust. My first night shift as a
Night Duty Officer was on January 5, 2024, and
the overall experience at the plant was fantastic.
We were supported by two female security guards
and one female medical assistant, which greatly
boosted our confidence. This initiative is crucial
as it ensures that women like me receive equal
opportunities. No one can say that a girl can't
work night shifts anymore. | genuinely enjoyed
the night shift and the support from the plant
and management has been incredible. I'm truly
thankful for this initiative.”

During the year, we undertook several DES1 initiatives across our units such as
bi-monthly HR connect with female employees, increased female GETs and DETs
hiring, financial literacy programmes, women health and well-being programmes,
rewards and recognition, among others. Some of the Gender Sensitisation
Programmes included:

Gender Intelligence Workshops

155 employees covered across Silvassa, Hirakud FRP, Copper S&M, Renukoot,
and Gare Palma

Snake and Ladder- Inclusion Game

+ First piloted at OUC, expanded to other units gradually
+ Administered at 10 branches across India
+ 2,000+ employees participated

Awareness Programmes

+ POSH Awareness Sessions: 2,379 management employees, 2,162 on-roll
workers and 20,801 contractual workers were covered

+ WAH Mentorship Programme: 12 Women Employees (ERG Members) who
mentor and guide women

+ POSH IC Member Training: 10 IC members attended in person meeting and

25 IC members attended virtual sessions

We celebrated women at Hindalco on
women’s day at Mumbai, which was
attended by more than 150 womenin
person and 70 women from other regional
offices. The theme was Resilience and
Authentic Presence to Accelerate
Actions, and the event revolved around
four pillars — Resilience, Authentic
Presence, Boldness, and Dexterity.
Similar events were conducted across all
the units and functions.

We ensure that women get access to
equal opportunities across all cadres.

At Hindalco, we have defined targets to
increase the share of women at various
levels by FY 2025-26. We aim to increase
the representation of women in the total
workforce (excluding workers) to 12%,
and in all management positions to 12%.
For junior management roles, the target
is 12.5%, while for top management
positions, we aspire to reach 6%. In
revenue-generating functions, our

goal is to reach 8%, and in STEM-
related roles, we are working towards
achieving 10% representation.

From first steps to firm strides —
celebrating 1 year of women on the night shift at Hirakud plant

Our commitment to enhancing gender diversity is reflected in measurable outcomes, as presented in the table below:

Prevention of Sexual
Harassment at Workplace

We are committed to fostering a
safe, respectful, and inclusive work
environment for all employees. In line
with the POSH Act, 2013, we have
implemented robust mechanisms

to prevent and address incidents of
sexual harassment at the workplace.

As mandated by the Act, we have
constituted an Internal Committee
(IC) at all our locations with 10 or more
employees, responsible for receiving
complaints, conducting fair and
timely inquiries, and recommending
appropriate action in accordance with
the principles of natural justice.

We also have aclearly defined POSH
Policy that outlines the procedures for
reporting, investigating, and resolving
complaints. Awareness sessions and
training programmes are conducted
regularly to sensitise employees

and promote a culture of dignity

and respect.

During FY 2024-25, we received six
complaints on sexual harassment with
action taken in three cases and three
cases pending for resolution. All six
complaints were upheld. All the cases
were received from female employees
and workers i.e., 0.10% of female
employees or workers. There were
zero cases of discrimination.

Grievance Redressal
Mechanism

At Hindalco, we have established
formal and structured grievance
redressal mechanism and systems.
Our Ethics Hotline gives employees
an anonymous mechanism to report
suspected violations of our Values
and Code of Conduct. We encourage
employees to speak up and report
violations, ensuring no retaliation
policy. All the employees and workers
have access to toll-free hotline number
wherein grievances are addressed

to the appropriate Unit or Business
Value Committee.

Gender Pay and
Remuneration

We offer a competitive compensation
package that rewards exceptional
achievements and aligns with industry
standards. Our Remuneration Policy
ensures a transparent and merit-based
approach to decision-making,
reflecting our commitment to fairness
and equity.

To uphold our commitment to equity,
we conducted a comprehensive
Gender Pay Gap Analysis through

an independent third-party — Willis
Towers Watson Public Limited
Company. The primary objectives of
this analysis were to determine whether
employees performing comparable
roles receive equitable compensation,
irrespective of gender and to identify
areas that may require further review.
We applied regression madels to
employee pay data, using relevant
control variables such as age, tenure
in level, job level, business group,
business unit group, job family and its
bifurcation, and performance rating.
This approach enabled us to identify
any pay differences and understand
the origins of any differences between
the average pay of men and women,
expressed as a percentage of the
average pay of men. The scope of the
assessment included senior, middle
and junior management employees.

As per the survey findings, we
observed an unadjusted pay gap? of
28%, indicating pay parity between

average salaries of men and women.
This figure aligns with prevailing trends
in the Indian manufacturing sector,
where unadjusted pay gaps typically
range between 30% and 40%. After
accounting for these controlling
variables, the adjusted pay gap?
narrowed significantly to 3.7%, which
is consistent with industry benchmarks
in the Indian manufacturing sector.
This approach allowed us to evaluate
disparities across roles and levels, and
to identify areas where greater balance
is needed. We remain committed to
further reducing this gap and have
initiated an action plan to promote
equitable compensation across

our organisation. Detailed outcome

of the analysis can be found in our
Gender Pay Gap Report, available

on our website.

Our performance-linked remuneration
framework considers individual
qualifications and experience.

To promote sustainability, we have
integrated sustainability parameters
into our annual incentive payout (AIP),
motivating employees to drive change
across the organisation. Our annual
incentive plan pay-outs are directly
linked to the achievement of key
financial and operational metrics.
These metrics include return on capital
expenditure, return on invested capital,
return on equity, ESG performance,
and individual performance.

The details of AIP are provided

in the Natural Capital section of

this report.

1 Unadjusted Pay Gap: The unadjusted pay gap is the difference in average pay between male and
female groups without taking into account any other influencing factors such as Job Level, Tenure

in Role, Performance rating etc.

2 Adjusted Pay Gap: The adjusted pay gap accounts for variables that typically influence pay (for this
study control variables selected include Age, Tenure in Level, Job Level, Business Group, Business
Unit Group, Job Family, Job Family bifurcation and Performance Rating) to identify the aspect of
pay gap that cannot be explained by measurable factors.

Management level employees include employees in the junior/middie/senior/top level.

94.17% of total femaile are in the junior management level. The pay gap is due to higher distribution of femaie employees in the junior level management
as compared to other level of managementi.e., top, senior, middie.

2 Non-management employees include on-roll workers/permanent workers. The observed pay disparity can be attributed to the significantly lower

representation of women among the total number of non- management employees compared to men.

evaluates local commodity price indices
across essential categories such as
food, housing, and clothing, while also
accounting for additional necessary
expenses including healthcare,

transportation, personal care, childcare,
and education. Similar assessments
were also done at other locations on
asampling basis. Based on these
evaluations, it was observed that all
employees are compensated at or
above the living wage threshold.

We achere to the laws and regulations
pertaining to employment of local
people, including Employment
Exchanges (Compulsory Notification

of Vacancies) Act, 1959, and other
prescribed local laws, or regulations

of respective state governments.
Employment to local people is

provided in accordance with the ratio
defined in the state-wise employment
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
for various categories such as unskilled
and semi-skilled, skilled, supervisory
management, and senior executives. In
alignment with the requirement of the
local regulations and our commitment
to build a resilient workforce, we

have well-defined strategies in place

to ensure local employment for our
operating plants and mines. Across

our operations in India, we have
implemented a company-wide policy on
local employment to ensure compliance
with employment regulations.

Considering our widespread presence
across various geographies in India,
we have defined local people at country
level. At the operating site level,
approximately 100% of employees

are local people, and near to 100%

of senior management positions are
held by employees hired from local
community. Furthermore, we offer
dedicated training and capability
development programmes to support
local unemployed individuals and
nurture leadership talent within the
community. More details regarding
these programmes are provided in
Social and Relationship Capital section

| Human Rights

At Hindalco, we are
committed to creating an
environment where every
individual is treated with
dignity, respect, and fairness,
that empowers people and
nurtures a strong sense

of belonging. To uphold

this commitment, we have
established a structured
human rights framework built
on four pillars: awareness
creation, risk assessment and
evaluation, development of
mitigation plans, and periodic
monitoring of progress.

Human Rights
Commitment

Our commitment to respect and
promote human rights is set out in

our Human Rights Policy, approved
by the Board of Directors. The policy
is applicable to employees, workers,
contractors, suppliers, agencies,
communities, and other stakeholders,
as appropriate.

The policy is guided by ILO's declaration
on fundamental principles and rights

at work, UN Guiding principles on
Business and Human rights, and other
internationally accepted standards. In
addition, we adhere to relevant Indian
labour laws, including regulations

on child labour, migrant labour, and
abolition of forced labour. We also
ensure compliance with applicable

laws in each state or country, where we
operate. We prohibit forced, bonded,
indentured, underage or prison labour in
any form. This also includes all forms of
modern slavery and human trafficking.
Any form of threat, coercion, physical
punishment, or abuse used to compel
work is strictly prohibited. We do not

confiscate or withhold originals of any
identification documents, passports, or
work permits of any employee/ workman.
Allemployment contracts are entered
into on a voluntary basis, without deposit
of money, and can be terminated without
penalties in accordance with applicable
laws and by providing reasonable notice,
as may be applicable. Employees and
workers are not confined or restricted

to move inside the facility except where
necessary for safety and restricted

by applicable laws. Our CHRO is
responsible for reviewing and addressing
human rights related issues and impacts
through representation at various
committees to the Board.

Human Rights Due
Diligence

We have adopted a structured Human
Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) process
to proactively identify and address
potential human rights impacts across
our own operations and value chain.
Using a self-assessment HRDD tool
deployed across all our units, we

cover a wide range of stakeholders
including employees, contract workers,
security personnel, women, children,
migrant workers, suppliers, indigenous
communities, and customers,
wherever relevant. We also conduct
due- diligence of our joint ventures,
whenever we enter into new agreement.
Additionally, all suppliers and business
partners comply with and formally
acknowledge the "Supplier Code of
Conduct," ensuring their commitment to
upholding human rights throughout their
operations and value chain.

AS part of our five-step HRDD
framework, we first identify key

human rights and associated risks
relevant to our industry. These include,
but are not limited to, child labour,
forced labour, sexual harassment,
workplace discrimination, human
trafficking, freedom of association,
right to collective bargaining, equal
remuneration, and wages. We then map
associated risks across our operations.

Next, we identify internal and external
stakeholders who may be affected by
operations to understand concerns
and integrate their feedback into our
strategy. These include employees,
workers, contractors including security
personnel, suppliers, customers,

and communities.

Further, we conduct risk assessment
at two levels. Level 1 analysis focuses
on identifying concerns at country,
industry, ABG business, and plant/
mine/office. Level 2 analysis evaluates
whether preventive measures have
been implemented by sites, suppliers,
and contractors.

We track and monitor risks using
heatmaps to visualise potential impacts
and enable prioritisation of efforts and
resources. Based on these insights,
we develop targeted action plans

with clear responsibilities, timelines,
and performance metrics to address
high-risk human rights areas and
ensure continuous improvement

in our human rights performance.
(Detailed information on Hindalco’s
HRDD process can be found in

IAR 2023-24).

During FY 2024-25, we assessed
100% of our plants, offices, and
suppliers on identified ‘Salient Human
Rights’ issues. As an outcome of

the assessment, no significant risks
related to human rights violations
were identified. Thus, no remediation
measures and business process
modifications were required.

As a preventive measure, we have
implemented mitigation plans at 5 sites.
We maintain a risk register across all our
plants and mines, wherein we also map
human rights-related risks.

In addition to self-assessmenits,

we conducted third-party HRDD
evaluations at 5 of our plants (Dahej,
Belagavi, Hirakud Power and Smelter,
Mahan and Taloja}. These reviews
analysed our human rights policies,
operational procedures, and supply
chain practices.

Human Rights Training and
Awareness

Integral to our human rights strategy is
human rights training, aimed at equipping
stakeholders with the necessary
knowledge to conduct risk assessments.
The training programmes are tailored to
relevant functions and locations.

During the reporting period, we provided
11,846 hours of human rights training

to employees at Hindalco India and
9,271 hours at Novelis. These sessions
covered topics such as Prevention of
Sexual Harassment (POSH), the Code
of Conduct, Supplier Code of Conduct,
understanding of 30 internationally
recognised human rights standards,
policies and procedures.

We also conducted a detailed session on
reporting mechanisms and escalation
channels for human rights concerns,

and common violations in industrial work
environments. In FY 2024-25, 45.95% of
employees and workers received training
on human rights issues and policies. This
represents a significant increase from

FY 2023-24 where approximately 10.74%
of employees and workers were covered.

Our unit teams engage regularly with
private security staff through ongoing
monitoring, audits, and targeted training
sessions that focus on legal compliance,
human rights, soft skills, conflict
resolution, and professional conduct.

These efforts ensure alignment with our
core values of dignity, respect, and ethical
behaviour. Additionally, these personnel
receive trainings on soft skills, crowd
management, and conflict resolution from
their respective organisations. During

the reporting period, 70% of security
personnel at Hindalco India operations
received 3,125 manhours training on
human rights policies and procedures.

We also maintain regular communication
with public security agencies to gain
local insights and share safety concerns,
strengthening our preparedness and
collaborative response. Each unit has
dedicated staff to oversee security
operations, monitor service quality,

and address any challenges faced by
security personnel.

At Hindalco, we have a pool of 90 internal
trainers certified by the Indian Society

for Training and Development (ISTD).
They are responsible for conducting
tailored training and awareness sessions
on fundamentals of human rights

for all our employees, including the
contract workers.

Managing Director’s Address on Human Rights Day

“In today’s world, we face growing challenges — rising
inequality, climate change, and increasing social
unrest. On this Human Rights Day, we pause, reflect,
and ask ourselves: What more can we do to build a
safer, more equitable world for everyone?

This responsibility starts with us to provide a safe,
respectful, and inclusive workplace for all our
employees, and to positively impact the communities
around our operations. Let this day be a reminder that
every step we take is a step toward a better future for all
— no matter how small — towards fairness, safety, and

sustainability.”

An awareness session on human rights for contractual workforce

Labour Management

Our labour management practices are
designed to uphold employees and
workers’ rights, promote workplace
harmony, and ensure compliance with
applicable labour laws. We actively
support freedom of association and
encourage collective bargaining to
strengthen employee representation
and dialogue. IN FY 2024-25, 42.22%
of the workforce were represented

by an independent trade union or
covered by collective bargaining
agreements. There has been an
increase in hiring of contractual
workforce to meet the expanding
business needs. We provide a
minimum notice period of 66 to 90
days to employees and 21 days to
workers in an event of changes in
operations as per Section-9 of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.

Strengthening Industrial Relations
through Progressive Long-Term Settlements

Over the past year, we have taken
significant strides in fostering a
culture of collaboration and progress
through the successful signing of

six Long-Term Settlements (LTS) by
engaging in harmonious and win-win
collective bargaining with the Unions
representing our permanent workers.
Each agreement is a testament of our
commitment to our people, to bring
alive the Group Purpose and Values.

Trust and transparency, along

with open dialogue and proactive
engagement were key enablers of
success, which ensured harmonious
environment and strengthened
industrial relations.

Following this approach, we were
able to conclude six Long-Term
Settlements, as highlighted below:

Aditya Aluminium:
Signed LTS ahead of expiry, ensuring
asmooth transition and stability.

Hirakud FRP:

Included manpower redeployment,
LMS alignment, anda
promotion scheme.

Mouda:

Enabled career growth and diploma-
holder hiring to boost skilled talent.

Lohardaga and Bagru Mines:

Introduced revised productivity
schemes supporting worker growth.

Belagavi:

Balanced productivity improvements
with employee welfare.

Through these progressive bi-lateral
agreements, we continue to foster
arespectiul, growth-oriented work
environment built on shared values
and sustainable practices.

To support our employees during the early phase of their parenting, we introduced
Gender-Neutral Creche Reimbursement Policy. The policy covers all management and
staff at office locations within Hindalco India operations. All manufacturing and mines

sites have creche facility available.

Under this policy, cost incurred for per month per child for the first two children is
reimbursed by the Company. This benefit can be claimed by all employees for the care

of their children/legally adopted children, regardless of employee’s marital status.
Reimbursement(s) under this Policy can be claimed for children up to the age of six years.

At Novelis, our total rewards package supports employees throughout the varying stages
of their life and career. Our holistic benefits package includes competitive pay, industry-
leading medical, dental, and retirement programmes, support for continuing education,
and paid parental leave for new mothers and fathers. Additionally, employees are also
entitled to paid family or care leave beyond parental leave.

Employee engagement
initiatives

Our people connect with each other
and the leadership through two-way
communication channels such as
monthly townhalls, leadership sessions,
round tables, among others. During the
reporting year, we introduced Samvaad
- Hindalco's Roundtable Discussions.
Samvaad sessions provide our
employees a platform to actively
participate, share insights, and engage
on topics such as generational dialogue
and gender-related challenges.

One of the interventions was a Chief
Human Resource Officer (CHRO)
townhall which focused on de-
emphasising hierarchical barriers,
where HR leadership team presented
key efforts and impacts of our people-
centric strategies.

In our ongoing journey to make Hindalco
a High Performing Contemporary
Organisation, every voice matters.

To achieve this objective, we conduct
employee engagement surveys on
various themes. Our ABG VIBES survey
measure employee satisfaction and
engagement on various parameters
including job experience, purpose,
happiness, and stress. This survey is
conducted by an independent third
party. We have transitioned form
conducting it once in two years to every
year in the spirit of continuous feedback.
Based on survey results, we develop
action plans at the organisational

and managerial levels and review

them periodically.

We also conduct the Manager
Effectiveness survey (Meffect}, Great
Place to Work survey, and detailed
HR stakeholder surveys. These
surveys provide valuable insights into
leadership efficacy, HR performance,
and workplace satisfaction, among
others. The insights derived from these
surveys help us to make informed
decisions that enhance the overall
employee experience.

At Novelis, we conducted our annual
Pulse Survey to assess employee
engagement and observed significant
improvements in engagement scores
and several other areas compared to
the previous year. We also introduced
new survey categories aligned with our
evolving goals and strategic priorities.

Highlights during FY 2024-25:

+ Witnessed 89% participation in the
VIBES survey FY2024-25 with an overall
engagement score of 92%. The previous
survey was conducted in FY2023-24.

+ Scored 89% on Manager Effectiveness
(84% previously), 86% on open
and honest communication (83%
previously), 92% on leadership
emphasising approachable culture (89%
previously) under the VIBES survey.

+ Conducted 66 Samvaad sessions
covering a range of tapics, including
employee satisfaction, managerial
effectiveness, team trust-building,
communication, gender parity, career
growth and development opportunities,
and wellness circles. The topics were
selected based on the results of the
GPTW and VIBES surveys, as wellas
feedback received from other platforms.

+ Conducted 103 townhalls with
participation over 2,200 unique
employees, enabling dialogue between
the groups on critical organisational
issues, addressing employee queries,
and gathering feedback.

+ Won the ABECA 2024 - AmbitionBox
Employee Choice Awards by securing
12th rank among top 20 large
companies’ category.

+ Novelis achieved an overall score of
78% (75% previously) with top level of
engagement, satisfaction, well-being, or
employee net promoter score (eNPS),
covering 75% (67% previously) of
employees.

HRiday
—OD Capability Building
Programme

HRiday, our flagship Organisational
Development (OD) capability-
building programme, made

a significant impact this year

by taking up the challenge of
addressing a long-standing issue
of low employee engagement

at the Mumbai office. A team of
17 HR professionals conducted
a diagnostic study with over 60
respondents through Focused
Group Discussions and

Personal Interviews.

The findings were presented to
the ExCom and senior HR leaders
and their recommendations were
incorporated in the action plan.

After the study, 16 employees were
identified and trained to conduct
Empathy Circles. This group
conducted three batches of HRiday
townhall and 27 Empathy Circles,
engaging over 240 employees.
After Empathy Circles, attendees
contributed to develop individual
and managerial action plan to
enhance workplace engagement
and support needed from the
organisation. With the completion of
the second batch of HRiday, a total
of 30 HR professionals have now
been OD certified.

The Empathy Circle initiative was
eventually integrated with our
Shillim cultural transformation
effort. We also formed a HRiday
Resource Group to analyse

data from the Shillim app and
recommend strategies to enhance
the engagement level. These
efforts were evident in our VIBES
2025 survey, where the employee
engagement score at our Mumbai
office rose from 87 to 90.

Cultural Transformation
Journey

We believe that experiences deeply
rooted in culture and delivered at scale
have the power to drive meaningful
transformation. We launched Shillim
movement in 2017 with a bold vision to
become a High Performing Contemporary
Organisation (HPCO} that is known for all
round excellence with specific focus on an
inclusive and contemporary culture. The
very first offsite became a turning point
which helped us excavate our Purpose.
Since then, Shillim has expanded in both
scale and spirit, bringing people together
across all levels on a single platform to co-
create our culture.

Even during the pandemic, we didn’t
pause. We adapted, taking Shillim

into the digital realm and proving our
resilience time and again. Despite
challenges such as uneven adoption,
the Shillim Core Team remain steadfast.
Every year, we introduced new
experiences to keep the movement alive
and meaningful for everyone.

We created compelling experiences that
resonated deeply with our people.

From Bhoomika Cards that celebrated
peer recognition, to My People Hour
{MPH) that fostered developmental
conversations, we kept evolving.

We empowered decision-making
through Empowerment by Design and
built transparency and openness with
the Gift of Trust exercise.

One ofthe most significant game changers
in our cultural journey has been the launch
of Regional Shillim, which has enabled
over 10,000 employees, including our
frontline workforce, to actively participate
in co-creating the culture at Hindalco.

This initiative has significantly broadened
the reach and inclusivity of our cultural
transformation efforts. In FY 2024-25, we
achieved several impactful milestones that
reflect the depth of engagement across the
organisation. More than 36,000 Bhoomika
recognitions were exchanged, celebrating
peer appreciation and reinforcing our
values. We conducted over 4,500 My
People Hour (MPH) discussions, which

facilitated meaningful developmental
conversations and strengthened
interpersonal connections. Additionally,
more than 600 decisions were devalved
through the MPH process, empowering
teams and encouraging ownership at
all levels. We also held 60 Gift of Trust
sessions, led by senior leaders across
various locations, which promoted
transparency, openness, and trust —
resulting in observable behavioural shifts
and measurable business outcomes.

Our grassroots programmes such

as Parivartan at Renukoot, Tamrodaya
at our Copper Business, and UDAAN at
Hirakud Power and Smelter (P&S) are
further reflections of how our cultural
transformation is deeply ingrained in our
people and business.

Here are some of the major interventions
undertaken during the reporting period:

Udaan

In April 2024, we launched UDAAN,
a large-scale transformation
initiative, at Hirakud P&S. The main
objective of UDAAN is to create a
workplace culture characterised by
ownership and engagemert, culture,
capability building, and growth
mindset, aiming to be a best-in-class
aluminium producer committed to
People, Planet, and Performance.

More than 80 employees came
together to design the transformation
roadmap, 540+ employees contributed
to change interventions, and 82% of
our frontline workforce contributed to
improvement initiatives. We filed over
2,500 Kaizens during the year.

We formed Focused Improvement
Teams (FIT) dedicated to identifying
and addressing key operational
challenges and performance
enhancements. Based on this
exercise, 9 projects were launched

in Wave 1, out of which 8 have been
completed. In Wave 2, 42 projects are
currently under execution.

— Transformation Journey at Hirakud P&S

We adopted 5S practices in our
Smelter and Power Blocks and
formed 25 general and shift- level
Cross- Functional Team (CFTs).

We conducted various employee
engagement initiatives, including
logo and name contest, cascading
sessions, mega housekeeping drive.
We drove capacity building and skill
development of employees through
Kaizen and §8 training programmes,
Systematic Problem Solving

(SPS), talent attraction cascading
awareness sessions.

Our Township Taskforce resolved
73% of 2,537 resident complaints,
emphasising our approach to growing
responsiveness and care. Through
‘Mo Hirakud Talks,’ 168 employees
had meaningful conversations with
their supervisors, while 8 Large Scale
Interactive Process {LSIP} sessions
empowered 1,651 employees to take
ownership of the transformation.

The Annual Shillim Awards recognise
people living behaviours in our ALERT framework

Project Varun

— Transitioning to Commissioning and Operations at Precipitated

Alumina Trihydrate (PPT ATH)

As Project Varun evolved into a fully
operational superfine PPT ATH
plant in Belagavi, we witnessed a
powerful cultural transformation
rooted in agility, accountability, and
collaboration. By adopting a process-
based organisational structure, we
enabled sharper cross-functional
alignment — vital for a 30 KTPA
facility demanding consistent
operational precision.

Within just two months, 85
professionals were onboarded through

a balanced hiring strategy combining

external talent, intra- and inter-unit
transfers, and members from the
original project team. This blend
ensured continuity, fresh energy, and
deep domain knowledge.

One of our standout achievements
was hiring women professionals,
who made up 31% of our new
recruits, an industry-leading move

in manufacturing. Every hire went
through a rigorous selection and
onboarding process, including
structured assessments, role clarity
sessions, and culture-fit evaluations.

Our Diploma Engineer Trainees
(DETs) underwent an intensive
two-month training programme
led by internal experts, covering
safety, SOPs, process control,
and troubleshooting.

With shift flexibility built in—including
for women—and former project team
members stepping into key operational
roles, we have built a workforce ready
to deliver 24x7 excellence. More

than just a plant, we have created a
culture that is agile, inclusive, and built
toscale.

Mahan, originally designed to
operate at 365 KA, has successfully
enhanced amperage through process
optimisation and change in lining
design to 376.3 KA. To increase the
current beyond 380 KA, new cathode
lining design, larger anodes, and
magnetic compensation loops (MCL)
are essential.

In line with this objective, HIC
Aluminium along with Mahan,
conceived atrial booster

section comprising 10 pots with each
pot designed to operate at 400 KA.
These pots are equipped with an
additional booster rectifier, magnetic
compensation loop, extended anodes,
and a newly developed cathode lining,
created in collaboration with our
technology centre.

The project is being executed in two
phases, with phase 1 focused on the
production of larger anodes with larger
area. This involved the installation

of vibro-compactor assemblies,

FTA height adjustments, upgrades

at Anode Baking Furnace (ABF)

and Anode Rod Shop (ARS), and

Optimisation of Sintering
Process for High Density,
Low Shrinkage Ceramic
Components

The initiative aimed to produce high-
quality alumina ceramics with superior
density, minimal shrinkage, and
excellent performance in demanding
engineering applications.

We focused on studying the effects of
temperature and sintering aid on the
sintering kinetics with a perspective
to obtain maximum sintered

density with minimal shrinkage,
reducing the need for excessive
post-machining of ceramics parts.
The objective of the initiative was to
enhance densification efficiency,
minimise shrinkage during sintering,
refine microstructure for superior
properties, improve thermal and
mechanical performance, and
optimise cost and energy efficiency.

By optimising the sintering process

of fine alumina, the initiative led to the
development of high-performance,
low-shrinkage ceramics with improved
properties, making them ideal for
cutting-edge engineering applications.

Technology
Development for Oxalate
Removal for Belagavi

Oxalate is an impurity in Bayer liquor
that impacts product quality and
retards the precipitation process.
Hence, we wanted to develop a
suitable process to increase oxalate
productivity in the liquor. The plant
conducted trials with different liquor
streams. Trials were also conducted
with blends of spent liquor and thick
liquor at different ratios.

It was observed that a higher oxalate
productivity of ~1.5 g/L was obtained
with 50:50 blend ratio compared

to 1.0 g/L productivity with only
spent liquor.

Development of Coating for Closure Stock

We produce approximately

500 tonne / month of coated
closures for pharmaceutical

uses. The coating material is
sourced from external supplier

as there are very few manufacturers
of pharma-grade closure stock
coating in India.

To gain a competitive edge and
reduce cost of production, we
started manufacturing the coating
in house. In FY 2024-25, 4 trials

of the coating were successfully
conducted and samples were
supplied to customer for
qualifications. Currently, we

are fine-tuning the formulation

to optimise performance and
process compatibility. The coating
is expected to bring about 30%
cost reduction and minimise our
dependency on external suppliers.

Cathode Quality Improvement: Parallel Flow Trials

To improve current density in copper
refining electrolysis, our Dahej copper
operations focused on reducing the
diffusion boundary layer — one of the
most controllable factors influencing
ion transport to the cathode. Industrial
operations typically operate at only
30-35% of the theoretical limiting
current density.

Different configurations were studied

Development of Food-grade Coating for Semi-Rigid

Containers (SRC)

Coated wrinkle-free food container is

aniche segment for the Indian market.

Producing coated, wrinkle-free food
containers requires a specialised
food-grade coating that is not readily
available in India. As a result, all such
containers are currently imported.
This reliance on imports directly
impacts production costs.

To address these constraints,
Hindalco decided to develop an
in-house food grade coating. This

proprietary solution was aimed at

reducing dependence on external
suppliers and offering a competitive,
high-performance alternative. Initial
trials revealed cracking during
punching, prompting ongoing
formulation improvements to enhance
flexibility, adhesion, and resistance
to forming stresses. In FY 2024 -25,
the SRC coating project advanced

to successful customer verification
trials, resulting in approximately 30%
cost reduction.

Development of Fume-Free Cutting Oils

At Alupuram and Silvassa plants,
significant health risks were faced by
the workforce due to harmful fumes
and smoke from the cutting oils used
in sawing operations.

To address this, we developed a
fume-free cutting oil specifically for
the Puller Saw and Finish Cut Saw.
The initiative was focused on creating
alow-emission, eco-friendly cutting
oil. We conducted lab evaluations
and successful plant trials which

significantly reduced smoke
generation, improved air quality, and
enhanced operator safety.

The new oil ensured smoother

cuts, reduced material waste, and
optimised lubricant consumption,
leading to a 20% reduction in
lubricant costs. Introducing the
fume-free cutting oil led to improved
workplace air quality, better cutting
performance, and a more flexible and
reliable supply chain.

to eliminate carry over slime from

the bottom to the cathode surface.
The new configuration increased the
relative velocity of the electrolyte,
resulting ina measurable reduction
in the thickness of the diffusion
boundary layer. This led to improved
mass transfer and more effective
distribution of inhibitors. The modified
setup enhanced process efficiency
and brought operations closer to the
theoretical current density limit.

Formulating Innovative Products and Solutions

At Hindalco, our Innovation Centres are
at the forefront of advancing our new
brand positioning - a strategic shift from
traditional metal manufacturing to

a value-added, innovation-led, and
sustainability-driven enterprise.

This vision is reflected in our RED
efforts to meet evolving market needs
with high-performance future ready
solutions. In FY 2024-25, we developed
11 new products and applications that
were accepted by customers. We also
developed 19 additional innovations,
reinforcing our commitment to

innovation and long-term value creation.

Among the notable innovations

in FY 2024-25 were advanced
material solutions designed for
high-performance and emerging
applications. We developed a High
Crystalline Alumina (HCA) series

for electro-ceramic applications,
Sub-micron Alumina (SMA) series for
high-value refractory use.

In the EV segment, we introduced BB59
alloy-grade sheets, designed for busbar
applications offering higher wire bond
strength and corrosion resistance. By
integrating additive manufacturing with
aluminium extrusion we enabled efficient
production of EV motor housings.
Additionally, we have improved the
material properties of aluminium foils
and extrusions used in Li-ion battery
enclosures, reinforcing our position as a
partner in next-generation mobility.

Recent developments include EV
battery enclosures, aluminium bulkers,
trailers, chassis, railway wagons,

and even modular kitchen solutions.
We also made significant progress

in manufacturing marine-grade
aluminium sheets, expanding our
portfolio to support high-performance,
specialised application.

Our proactive approach to product
development, driven by continuous
market applications, has givenus a
first-mover advantage. This is reflected
through developing of Spherical Alumina,
Hydratable Alumina, and Bimodal
Hydrate for solid surface applications.

At the same time, we are expanding our
research into new areas such as copper
anode and cathode quality, refinery
bleed optimisation, metal purification and
recycling, and effluent treatment plant
(ETP) load reduction. Together, these
initiatives reflect our holistic innovation
strategy, balancing performance,
sustainability, and self-reliance.

At Novelis, as part of our commitment to
sustainable innovation, we are advancing
the development of high recycled
content alloys across key sectors such
as beverage packaging, automotive,
aerospace, and specialty applications. In
beverage packaging, we are pioneering
circular solutions through alloys like
AA3104 (Unialloy) and intermediate
AA5xxx series, which offer enhanced
recyclability and performance for can

ends. These materials not only reduce
environmental impact but also maintain
the performance standards required

by the industry. Leveraging our deep
expertise and advanced tools surface
characterisation —-we are streamlining the
adoption of these next-generation alloys.

Building on the momentum, in aerospace,
we collaborated with a leading aircraft
manufacturing company on a novel friction
stir welded (FSW) fuselage demonstrator,
using a newly developed clad layer material
system. This innovation, part of a German
government-funded project, achieved a
21kg weight reduction per aircraft section
—translating to an estimated 7 tonnes of
CO, savings annually. Inthe specialty
segment, we introduced a high-recycled-
content 3105+Zn alloy for industrial heat
exchangers, replacing high prime content
materials while maintaining electrical
conductivity and mechanical performance.

These advancements are complemented
by our progress in the automotive sector,
where we are developing alloys that are
more tolerant to recycled content. We
have also completed the development of
Hot Rollto Gauge process technology for
producing thicker gauge sheet materials,
and are advancing roll-formedw, high-
frequency welded aluminium tubes for
vehicle crash structures. Additionally, our
work on pre-coated aluminium sheets is
enabling more sustainable and efficient
solutions for automotive applications.

Pr new products and
applications commercialised,
with 19 additional innovations
under development-
reinforcing our commitment
to long-term value creation.

Development of Low
Soda Boehmite for
Lithium-ion Battery
Separator Application

Boehmite (Y-AlOOH) is
monohydrate aluminium oxide
and a Super Value-Added
Product (SVAP), used primarily

in the electroceramics industry
especially in separators for
lithium-ion batteries. High-purity
Boehmite for lithium-ion batteries
is expected to see significant
growth in the coming years, driven
by the rise of electric vehicles. Its
key applications include battery
separators, anode edge coatings,
catalysts, thermal conductive
fillers, and flame retardants.

We initiated the development

of low-soda Boehmite using
hydrothermal technology, enabling
precise control over temperature
and pressure.

A Boehmite production process
was successfully developed
through the dedicated efforts

of scientists and technicians at
our innovation centres. The final
product has been approved by our
customers. We also established
three design of experiments using
the Taguchi method to support the
commissioning of a pilot plant at
Belagavi. The method developed
is now being scaled up for full-
scale production. Boehmite will
enable us to further diversify our
portfolio into Super Value-Added
Products (SVAPs).

Hydrate as a Filler in Aluminium Composite Panels

Aluminium Trihydrate (ATH) is
preferred by industries due to its
environmental friendliness, with

a potential to reduce the amount

of costly materials used in the
Aluminium Composite Panel (ACP)
core, thus lowering manufacturing
costs. The ATH’s properties

like flame retardancy, smoke
suppression, mechanical strength
improvement, and thermal stability
are ideal for use in ACP. After the
building and construction industry,
transportation and electrical
appliances are the next biggest users
of ATH-filled composite panels.

Itis anticipated that ATH will grow

in demand as a flame-retardant
across arange of industries as fire
safety awareness and regulatory
compliance rise. Due to the high
profitability of this industry, Hindalco
took the initiative to enter the Flame-
Retardant segment of ACP industry.

Our initiative to use ATH in ACP
follows a structured methodology
to ensure fire safety, mechanical

strength, and cost-effectiveness.
During the research and
development stage, we first
selected the appropriate materials,
optimised the ATH to be used in
ACP and tested it in the lab. Further,
in the manufacturing stage, the
focus was on high purity ATH. In

the third-party vendor stage, the
suitable formulation using ATH

has been made into the core of
ACP and subsequently various fire
performance tests, mechanical
properties evaluation and regulatory
compliance tests have been

carried out.

We established the MHV20 grade
which is a ball-milled hydrate, and
has already been commercially
supplied to the customer end.
Furthermore, the moisture reduction
(< 0.15) of ATH has been initiated
to improve further performance of
ATH in ACP. The ATH has already
attracted commercial supplies and
is opening new market segments
for Hindalco.

Development of Modular Kitchen Components

Aluminium is fire, moisture, and
termite resistant and has high
strength-to-weight ratio and thus
has a strong potential to bea
material of choice in the rapidly
growing modular kitchen market.

In FY 2024-25, we developed
aluminium modular kitchen
components that has high strength,
corrosion resistance, and a premium
surface finish, targeting households
in tier 1 and tier 2 cities in India.

The initiative, developed in
collaboration with the ABSTC,

worked on the design feasibility,
material finalisation, and prototyping.
We developed four kitchen designs in
line with customer demographics and
requirements. The modular kitchen
has the potential to significantly
impact the market, with an estimated
EBITDA of 74 crore per annum

by FY 2030 and 7116 crore per
annum by FY 2035. The Hindalco
kitchen was unveiled at the Hindalco
Masterbrand launch event on 18
March 2025, and prototypes are in
preparation for the product launch in
August 2025.

for Electric Vehicles

We have made a significant stride in
India's electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem
by delivering 10,600 aluminium battery
enclosures to a leading automotive
manufacturer for their new electric
SUV models.

Development of Battery Enclosures

Co-developed with them, the
aluminium enclosures offer:

+ Upto 40% weight reduction compared
to traditional steel designs

+ 8-10% improvement in driving range

+ Enhanced crash safety and superior
thermal management, crucial for
battery performance in diverse
Indian climate

The enclosures are made using low-
carbon aluminium, aligning with the
commitment of both companies to
sustainable mobility. This partnership
is a strategic move to localise
high-performance EV components and
reduce dependence on imports, while
also supporting their ambition to lead
India’s EV transition.

Hindalco successfully delivered 10,000 aluminium battery enclosures from
its Chakan plant to an auto major, notching a milestone in India’s clean mobility journey

Performance Improvement at Renukoot

Anode Baking Furnace

At Renukoot, we faced challenges with
sub-par baking levels of anodes and high
specific energy consumption. ABSTC,
along with the plant team, conducted
computation fluid dynamic (CFD)
simulation analysis and measurements
(thermal mapping, gas pressure,
temperature, and composition) to
identify the root causes.

The analysis of the existing design
using CFD, helped us identify
key factors for improvement.

We initially tested a modified design
in two flue walls, and based on
encouraging results, we deployed
this design in 16 more flue walls.
To improve combustion and baking
homogeneity, we changed the
injection pattern from co-current
to counter-current mode. As a
result, the initiative helped in
improving baking homogeneity and
a reduction in low sulphur heavy
stock (LSHS) consumption.

Development of Carbon
Coating for Lithium-ion
Battery Foils

For higher power and fast
charging applications, carbon-
coated aluminum foils are
preferred due to their ability to
reduce interfacial resistance,
improve rate capability, and
enhance cycle life.

At ABSTC, we developed a
carbon black-based conductive
primer coating for aluminum
battery foils, which are used

in various energy storage
applications like Li-ion batteries.
The work focused on developing
and scaling up this coating to
meet the specifications required
by domestic and international
customers. We optimised the
slurry formulation, conducted
roll-to-roll coating trials, and
achieved the desired physical and
electrochemical properties.

The domestic demand for coated
battery foil is expected to grow
significantly, with potential
additional EBITDA of 250 crore
by 2030. We are planning further
trials in China to validate our
product on acommercial scale.

Optimisation of Pre-
Calcination Circuit to
produce High Surface
Area Alumina

At our Belagavi refinery, we
produce high surface area alumina
using flash calcination. This
alumina, known as activated or
hydratable alumina, contains
Rho and Chi phases and is used
in applications like catalyst
support and special cement.
Currently, we achieve a surface
area of 150-180 m?/g and are
aiming for 200-250 m*/g to meet
market standards.

Our ABSTC team optimised
operations using CFD studies
and experiments. After this, we
developed models, built a pilot
calciner, and redesigned our
pre-calciner circuit, achieving
255 m%¥/g in initial trials.

More controlled trials are planned
for bulk production.

Hydratable alumina for castable
applications has a potential
market demand of 5KTPA,

with estimated annual benefit

of 210 crore in EBITDA. We further
plan to explore the market demand
for activated alumina.

Development of
Indigenous Soda
Ash Briquettes for
Aluminum Smelters

When global supply chain
disruptions and rising operational
risks began to impact our
aluminium smelting operations,
we recognised the urgent need

to rethink our dependence on
imported soda ash briquettes.
Mahan aluminium team turned
adversity into innovation by
developing India’s first indigenous
soda ash briquettes for aluminium
smelters. We were reliantona
dominant overseas supplier whose
products, while effective, came at
a high cost and were vulnerable
to international crisis. The only
domestic alternative, powdered
soda ash, posed significant safety
risks, frequently causing “soda
blasts” during potline start-ups.

Through the IGNITE innovation
platform, a cross-functional

team at Mahan collaborated

with an external organisation to
overcome technical challenges
such as achieving the right density,
strength, and moisture resistance
in the briquettes. After multiple
trials and process optimisation,
they successfully engineered

a robust, cost-effective, and

safer alternative that matched
imported quality.

This innovation led to introduction
of a domestic alternative, which
disrupted the monopoly held by
foreign suppliers and compelled
them to reduce prices. The
solution helped in achieving
savings of 718,000 per metric
tonne, totalling 758 lakhs over

14 months, with projected

annual savings of #76 lakh at

our Mahan plant. Adoption by
Aditya Aluminium added another
26 lakh in savings, validating the
solution's scalability.

Technology Development for Gallium Recovery

from Bayer liquor

Gallium is an important strategic
metal with major applications in
high-capacity data storage devices,
wireless infrastructure and defence
applications, including new 5G
networks. About 90-95% of the total
consumption of Gallium is in the
form of Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)

and Gallium Nitride (GaN). At present,
India imports Gallium metal from
China and other countries. To avoid
any disruptions due to import
restrictions, we are conducting initial
lab studies to optimise the conditions
for extracting Gallium metal from
Bayer liquor at our Renukoot refinery.

In FY 2024-25, we have been
working with various vendors and
technology partners to extract
Gallium as part of the alumina
refinery operations. We have
identified a technology provider, with
whom the work has been done for
setting up pilot operations at Muri,
considering the higher percentage
of Gallium present in Bayer liquor.
The quality of the product from
this process is expected to be

AN purity gallium.

Reduction in Process Downtime of Copper Smelter

We used to face frequent downtime
caused by the formation of hard
accretion at the throat of the
Waste-Heat Boiler (WHB).

To address this problem, the
ABSTC team conducted a
comprehensive analysis and
implemented a solution. Accretion
samples were characterised,
revealing the composition and
formation mechanisms, and CFD
modeling was used to study gas flow
and dust deposition and identify
high-risk areas. Based on these
insights, we designed a solution to
inject air at the throat of the WHB

to prevent dust accumulation and
improve dust sulphation.

This initiative can help save costs

by preventing the need for frequent
shutdowns and reducing maintenance
required for accretion removal. A gain
in production is also expected due

to the increase in furnace uptime,
increase in boiler life due to reduced
blasting to remove buildup as well as
manpower safety because of fewer
manual interventions. The expected
profit after full implementation is
estimated at ¥12 Cr. due to 50%
reduction in downtime.

organisational objectives. By doing

so, we strive to continuously improve

our environmental performance and
uphold our commitment to sustainability.
Additionally, before starting any new
operation, we conduct a comprehensive
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
in accordance with applicable laws and
regulations. We also maintain detailed
impact registers across our plants to
systematically identify and monitor the
environmental footprint of our operations.

For us, sustainability is not merely a
commitment but an integral part of our
DNA. Thisis clearly reflected through

our Annual Incentive Payout (AIP) which
is designed to promote sustainable
practices by linking incentives to
environmental KPIs which is applicable
to executives and management level
employees. These parameters include
100% utilisation of fly ash for all power
plants, including cogeneration units, a5%
reduction in specific water consumption,
zero waste to landfill, 100% utilisation of
bauxite residue (red mud) across three
refineries, 10% utilisation of bauxite
residue for Utkal, and management of
energy consumption in line with the plan.
Additionally, it also includes KPIs related
to compliance to regulatory requirements
and plantations. By incorporating

these parameters, we demonstrate our
dedication to environmental sustainability
and drive concrete actions and
accountability within our organisation.

Our commitment to sustainability also
fosters our continuous investment

in diverse initiatives. Leveraging
digital tools such as Enablon and
ESG Compass enables us to track
and monitor environment-related
projects and KPIs effectively. The ISO
14001:2015 certification for all our

India operations and 29 Novelis plants
establishes a robust framework for
compliance management and continual
enhancement of environmental
performance. All our Novelis plants
undergo audits once over a four-year
period internally or by third parties.
Furthermore, our dedication to
sustainable practices is underscored
by the certification of 8 Hindalco plants,
21 Novelis plants, 15 scrap centres
under the Aluminium Stewardship
Initiative (ASI) Standards. Our copper
concentrate procurement has achieved
Joint Due Diligence Standard under
Copper Mark Certification.

Additionally, two of our facilities in
North America — Davenport, lowa,
and Uhrichsville, Ohio — produce
flat-rolled aluminum sheet with up to
99% recycled content. Every year,
these products undergo GreenCircle
certification, which provides a detailed,
science-based evaluation to verify the
amount of pre- and post-consumer
recycled content.

Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures

At Hindalco, our commitment to
protecting nature is integral to

our operations. We acknowledge

our reliance on natural resources

and responsibility to minimise
environmental impact. To strengthen
this commitment, we have adopted the
Taskforce on Nature-related Financial
Disclosures (TNFD) framework to
manage nature-related risks and
opportunities effectively. Climate

change, freshwater use, resource
replenishment, land-use change,
pollution, and the threat of invasive
alien species are key drivers of nature
change that closely align with our
material topics, guiding our strategies
and commitments.

By comprehensively understanding
the risks associated with our
impacts and dependencies on the

surrounding ecosystem, we aim

to proactively address challenges

and foster a culture of responsible
environmental stewardship. This
ensures that we integrate nature-
related risks into our business strategy,
promoting sustainable practices

that not only mitigate environmental
impacts but also enhance our
operational resilience.

Continue to lead the industry toward circularity through
first-mover investments

Decarbonising the melting processes
and energy sources - Although our
operations are less energy-intensive than
primary aluminium production, melting
scrap aluminium remains the most
energy-intensive process. To reduce
emissions, we are exploring alternative
fuels, clean electricity sources, waste
heat recovery, and innovative carbon
capture technology while implementing
new efficiency-enhancing technologies
to reduce fuel and energy use across our
plants. Our Latchford plant is participating
in the regional hydrogen network project
to evaluate the feasibility of using
low-carbon hydrogen.

Maximising circularity - Increasing our
use of recycled content is key to reducing
carbon emissions in our products. We
are expanding closed-loop programmes
and are investing in new approaches and
partnerships along the value chain.

Innovating new high recycled content
alloys - We are collaborating with
customers from key industries such

as beverage packaging, automotive,
aerospace, and specialities to develop
high-recycled-content alloys that meet
their technical specifications.

Increase recycling capacities and
capabilities - Our recycling content

has doubled in the past 15 years, and
we invested more than $ 1.1 billion

since 2011. We are increasing the
recycling capacities and capabilities with

around projects worth ~$5 billion under
execution. We commissioned recycling
capacities at Guthrie, USA, and UAL,
South Korea, in FY 2024-25; Bay Minette,
USA and Latchford, UK, are expected to
be commissioned in FY 2026-27.

Supporting decarbonisation of
primary aluminium - We are focused on
procuring low-carbon primary aluminium
to supplement the use of recycled
content. We are expanding our primary
supplier network to secure the low-carbon
aluminium and collaborating with the
World Economic Forum's First Movers
Coalition (FMC)- a global initiative aimed
at decarbonising “hard-to-abate” sectors.

Novelis Drives Energy Efficiency in Melting Facilities

Committed to advancing operational
efficiency, we designed the Ideal
Furnaces Programme to reduce
energy consumption at our melting
facilities by upgrading our furnaces to
state-of-the-art technology.

Our operations team benchmarked
best practices across our plants,
identifying key applications that
yield the most substantial impact
and developing compelling business

cases for large-scale implementation.

Through rigorous evaluation, we
identified and executed capex

projects that integrate these best
practices, ensuring maximum
efficiency gains.

By upgrading the furnaces, ata
cost of US$9.7 million, we achieved
a reduction of 473,490 GJ of
energy consumption leading to
annual savings of US$7 million.
This programme represents

a transformative step toward
achieving energy efficiency in our
operation and strengthening our
financial performance.

Trials at Novelis have shown that switching from natural gas
to hydrogen in remelting reduced CO,e emissions by up to 90%

Successful Trials of Hydrogen in Aluminium

Remelting at Novelis

At Novelis, we completed testing of
hydrogen fuel in powering a recycling
furnace at our Latchford plant in

UK, marking a significant step in
decarbonisation. We upgraded our
infrastructure with new burners,
regenerators, and furnace lining to
run comprehensive trials blending
hydrogen with natural gas. These
tests showed that switching from
natural gas to hydrogen could reduce
CO,e emissions by up to 90%.

GHG Emissions Management

Through continuous innovation,
strategic investments, and cutting-edge
initiatives, we are making a measurable
impact by reducing our carbon footprint
and driving progress toward our goals.

In FY 2024-25, our total Scope 1

and Scope 2 emissions stood at
30.01 million tCO,e, with Hindalco
contributing 27.76 million tCO,e and
Novelis 2.25 million tCO,e. Within
Hindalco India, aluminium operations
accounted for 26.82 million tCO,e

of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions,
while copper operations added 0.89
million tCO,e. Additionally, our mines
generated 0.05 million tCO,e.

During these trials, we remelted

and cast several hundred tonnes

of 3000 series scrap aluminium

into sheet ingots while closely
monitoring product quality, process
performance, and environmental
impact. This project aligns with our
broader support of the UK’s £1 billion
Net Zero Innovation Portfolio. With
grant support of £4.6 million, we’re
helping lead the shift from natural gas
to low-carbon hydrogen.

At Hindalco, we track five categories

of scope 3 emissions. In the reporting
year, the Scope 3 emissions

accounted for 14.12 million tCO,e,

of which 2.69 million tCO,e was from
Hindalco and 11.43 million tCO,e

was from Novelis. At Hindalco and
Novelis the Scope 3 emissions are
dominated by the purchased goods and
services category.

We follow the GHG Protocol-

A Corporate Accounting and
Reporting Standard supplemented by
IPCC guidelines.

Emission Intensity

We closely track emission intensity
(Scope 1+2) to measure our progress
toward sustainability goals and
targets. In aluminium operations, we
have achieved a 19.50% reduction in
emission intensity compared to the
FY 2011-12 baseline of 24.1 tCO,e per
tonne. This increase in intensity is due
to ahigher number of pot start-ups and
more frequent power outages at the
Renukoot smelter.

In India, we have an integrated
aluminium value chain from bauxite
mining to the manufacture of primary
metal and beyond. Utkal Alumina is
an integral part of our operations.
The specific energy consumption (on
physical output basis} is disclosed
taking into account Hindalco India
Limited and Utkal Alumina together.

During the reporting period, the
emissions intensity per rupee

of turnover for our Hindalco

India operations accounted for
274,74 tCO,e/% crore as compared to
309.85 tCO,e/% crore in the previous
year. The emissions intensity per
rupee of turnover adjusted for PPP2
accounted for 567.62 tCO,e/$ million
as compared to 694.1 tCO,e/$ million
in the previous year.

At Novelis, emission intensity is
measured as the total Scope 1, 2, and
3 emissions per tonne of flat-rolled
products (FRP) shipped. Through our
continuous sustainability efforts, we
have successfully reduced emission
intensity to 3.64 tCO,e per metric
tonne of FRP shipped from the 2016
baseline of 5.5 tCO,,e per metric tonne
of FRP shipped.

Improving
Ambient Air
Quality

Air emissions

At Hindalco, we are dedicated to
contributing to a cleaner future by
innovating and collaborating with
stakeholders to improve air quality.

We identify our impact by consistently
tracking and monitoring air emissions
through an Online Continuous Emission
Monitoring System (OCEMS). Our
internal system, Enablon, allows us

to capture real-time emission data,
enabling data led decisions while
ensuring full compliance with regulatory
standards and reporting requirements.

We conduct regular audits to verify
the reliability of the data which is
supplemented by offline monitoring
through NABL-accredited third-party
laboratories. Since our upstream
plants are a key source of emissions,
we monitor the Air Quality Index (AQI)
using Continuous Ambient Air Quality
Monitoring System (CAAQMS) in

all directions.

Our air emissions management is
governed by a robust monitoring
framework. Each plant has an Air Task
Force (ATF), led by the operations
head and supported by experts from

operations, environment, and the
utilities departments. The ATF is
responsible for tracking emissions
and overseeing key projects aimed

at emissions reduction. Progress

is reviewed quarterly by the Chief
Sustainability Officer, ensuring
alignment with our sustainability targets
and goals. Additionally, the Apex
Sustainability Committee, chaired

by our Managing Director, provides
strategic oversight, further reinforcing
our commitment to long-term
environmental stewardship.

At Hindalco India, the increase in air
emissions is attributed to the rise in
primary metal production. However, our
‘Clean Air to Breathe for All’ initiatives
have led to a reduction in particulate
matter emissions. At Novelis, the
decrease in air emissions is due to the
closure of two plants. In the reporting
year, we started a new recycling facility
at Guthrie and accounted for the total
air emissions. Additionally, our Novelis
operations produced 1.69 KT of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs).

We have implemented several initiatives
to minimise emissions, such as:
Hindalco Rail Maintenance Yard

To address air pollution from painting
and grit blasting BTAP wagons, we will

Windscreens installed at the coalyard in Dahej to reduce
air emissions, ensuring cleaner air for everyone.

collect paint chips in an impervious pit,
and a bag filter installation is planned
within six months. Additionally, we
maintain a rail and road coefficient

of 47% and 53% to increase cost
efficiency and reduce emissions.

YeongJu Plant

We installed Activated Carbon
technology in the Residual Carbon
Management Unit (RCMU) to
significantly reduce dioxin emissions.
We use advanced adsorption systems
to prevent the release of pollutants
achieving a 30% reduction from
regulatory limits.

Zhenjiang Plant

We installed a Selective Catalytic
Reduction (SCR) technology in the
casting line, with a 450 m*/min capacity,
effectively removing NOx emissions and
enhancing air quality.

Nachterstedt Rolling Plant

We installed a Regenerative Thermal
Oxidizer (RTO) with heat recovery

to reduce CO emissions, whichis
scheduled for commissioning in

FY 2025-26.

These efforts reinforce our commitment
to environmental compliance, air quality
management, and emission reduction
across our operations.

initiative aligns with the broader
environmental goals outlined by the
Ministry of Environment, Forest and
Climate Change (MoEFCC) under
the National Clean Air Programme
(NCAP), aimed at preventing,
controlling, and abating air pollution
in urban and regional areas.

After the assessment, we
proactively installed 68 advanced
emission control devices across
identified locations. This significant
compliance effort was supported by
a capex allocation of 15.97 crore,
underscoring our commitment

to sustainable operations and air
quality improvement.

" Clean Air to Breathe for All

At Hindalco, we are dedicated to
improving air quality and minimising
environmental impact through our
‘Clean Air to Breathe for All’ project.

Reducing SOx Emissions with Flue
Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) Units

To tackle sulphur oxide (SOx)
emissions from fuel combustion,

we commissioned FGD units at

our Aditya and Mahan plants.

These installations have led to an
impressive 60% reduction in SOx
emissions at both plants, reinforcing
our commitment to cleaner air.

The installation of FGD is actively
underway at Renusagar.

Auto-Lime Dosing System for
Effective Sulphur Removal

At Hirakud and Muri, we have
deployed Auto-Lime Dosing Systems,
a technology for reducing sulphur
emissions from stacks. These
systems inject hydrated lime or
quicklime into the flue gas stream,
enabling a chemical reaction that
neutralises sulphur dioxide and
forms calcium sulphate, which is
later removed. This system has also
helped us to adhere to regulatory
norms while advancing sustainability.

Transition to Cleaner Fuels

To significantly reduce particulate
matter (PM) and SOx emissions,
we are shifting from heavy fuel

oil to cleaner alternatives such

as piped natural gas (PNG) in

our furnaces and smelters. This
transition ensures lower emissions
and greater efficiency, supporting a
greener footprint.

Striving for ‘Good’ Ambient Air
Quality Index (AQ!)

In alignment with national standards,
we are committed to achieving ‘Good’
Ambient Air Quality Index (AQI:
0-50) in and around our operations.
To make this vision a reality, we have
introduced several measures to
enhance air quality:

+ Clean Transportation:
Adopted solar-powered and
battery-operated vehicles for
internal mobility.

+ Eco-Friendly Bulk Material
Movement: Switched to gas-based
and electric options for external
transport of bulk materials.

+ Fugitive Emissions Control:
Implemented closed conveyors,
fog cannons, water sprinklers,
wind barriers, dense green
cover, and bag filters to curb
airborne pollutants.

Through these comprehensive
initiatives, we continue to lead

the way in sustainable air quality
management, ensuring a healthier
environment for all.

Transition from Heavy
Fuel Oil to Natural
Gas in Anode Baking
Furnaces at Aditya

The anode baking process which is
crucial to aluminium production is
energy-intensive and a significant
source of emissions.

Atour Aditya smelter, we previously
relied on Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) for the
process in anode baking which led toa
higher emission footprint. To address
this, we conducted a feasibility study to
convert the HFO-based firing system to
anatural gas-based one. Consequently,
we identified gas pipeline projects

to ensure an uninterrupted supply of
natural gas. With a capex of F40 crore,
we successfully commissioned this
project in two units.

This initiative has resulted ina 60%
reduction in SOx emissions, leading
tocleaner operations and reduced
production costs. It has also contributed
toa29% reduction in the cost of fuel per
tonne of baking (from %2,600/tonne to
¥1,844/tonne) and a29% reduction in
the cost of fuel per tonne of hot metal
(from 71,066/tonne to %756/tonne).

Novelis Installs Air
Pollution Control
System at Ulsan

As environmental regulations
become increasingly stringent,
we have implemented air
pollution control systems to
minimise emissions and ensure
compliance. In the cold line at
Ulsan, we installed a bag house
to efficiently capture and remove
dust, reducing particulate matter
to less than 30% of the regulatory
limit. For the hot line, we deployed
acomprehensive system to tackle
multiple pollutants, including
Selective Catalytic Reduction
(SCR), a Bag House, anda
Scrubber. This system is expected
to control emissions, keeping
dust levels below 30% of the

limit, NOx below 60%, and HCI
below 50%, significantly reducing
environmental impact. We have
also installed an SCR in the pusher
furnace, with a capacity of 1,148
m*/min, to effectively remove

NOx emissions.

At Hindalco, under the Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme, eight of our plants are
identified as Designated Consumers (DC). Seven of these plants — Renukoot, Mahan,
Hirakud, Utkal, Belagavi, Muri, and Taloja, were identified in previous cycles (| and II),
while one plant, Aditya Aluminium, was identified in cycle II. We achieved 9% and 8.8%
energy savings against the 4.7% and 6% targets, respectively, in cycles II and III. We have
successfully secured a total of 248,706 Energy Saving Certificates (ESCerts) under the

PAT scheme, recognising our ongoing efforts
to reduce specific energy consumption.

India’s Carbon Credit Trading Scheme

is developed in line with PAT. While PAT
focuses on energy consumption norms,
CCTS is built around greenhouse gas (GHG)
emission intensity norms. In FY 2023-24,
authorised agencies completed baseline
audits across all our plants, capturing
baseline production and GHG emissions
(tCO,/t) as outlined in the notification. All our
facilities are on track to achieve the emission
reduction targets specified in the notification.
Aswe begin integrating large-scale RTC
renewable energy for an aluminium

smelter, we're navigating several technical,
commercial, and operational challenges.
Despite these challenges, our planned
projects will enable us to meet the CCTS
targets effectively.

At Novelis, to enhance energy efficiency and
minimise Scope 1 and 2 emissions, we have
implemented various advanced technological
systems. Our furnace burners have been
upgraded from cold air to regenerative
systems, significantly improving fuel
efficiency. We’ve also integrated a furnace
automation control system and installed a
magnetic stirrer in the furnace of our recycling
plant to optimise operations. Additionally,
annealing of the furnaces has been carried out
to enhance performance, and a screw inverter-
type air compressor has been installed to
further streamline energy consumption.

To minimise Scope 3 emissions, we are
enhancing recycling capacities and
capabilities and collaborating with
customers and partners to implement
closed-loop recycling systems. Additionally,
we are pioneering the development of
new alloys that incorporate a higher
percentage of recycled inputs and can
be efficiently repurposed into high-value
products at the end of their lifecycle. By
engaging across the value chain, we

are ensuring that materials are neither
downcycled nor diverted to landfills.

During the reporting period, we avoided
approximately 8,290 tCO,e emissions

by recycling 84 billion used beverage
cans. Our products contain 63% recycled
content, with a total of 2,363 KT of scrap
material processed and helping us avoid
nearly 20 million tCO,e emissions overall.

| Water Stewardship in Action

We firmly acknowledge the significance of water management for the continuity of our operations.
In our commitment to sustainability, we have embraced Niti Aayog’s 3M+7R framework, not only to
achieve water neutrality but also to significantly enhance our operational efficiency.

obtained the Scope 1 (Aspiring
category) certification which
emphasises the maximisation of
operational efficiency. Additionally,

these plants have water saving potential
of approximately 5 million m3. Next year,
we plan to obtain Scope 1 certification
for five more plants. In the coming years,
we plan to pursue Scope 2 certification
which focuses on promoting operational
sustainability and addressing critical
water supply chains.

Recognising the need for sustainable
water management, we have instituted
a dedicated Water Task Force (WTF)
in each unit to address water-related
risks and opportunities. This team

has a lead, a convenor and other
members. The WTF conducts water-

Water Risk Management for
Safeguarding Operations

As water scarcity grows, the risks
associated with water availability and
quality also rise. To evaluate the potential
effects on our operations, we conducted
awater risk assessment utilising the
WBCSD's India Water Tool (IWT) and
the WRI Aqueduct Tool. Our analysis
examined several key aspects, such

as baseline water stress, annual and
seasonal fluctuations, occurrences of
flood, drought intensity, upstream storage
capacity, and groundwater stress, while
also considering dependency and
impact-related risks. The results showed
that four plants—Dahej, Belagavi, Asoj,
and Kuppam—are situated in water-
stress regions.

We have identified scenario-wise risks
and their operational impact on each
plant and the assessment revealed a
high risk of seasonal variability across
our plants. To measure the seasonal
variability, we took into account
scenarios such as flash floods, changes

>

The task forces conduct cross-
functional audits to identify
opportunities for improvement in water
management; and in the reporting year,
we conducted audits at 10 plants.

At Hindalco, we have 22 Effluent
Treatment Plants (ETPs) and 31
Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs),

and we review their performance
periodically. Till date, we have reviewed
9 ETPs and 13 STPs of which 7 ETPs
and 6 STPs were assessed in the
reporting year.

Water Taskforce Members

+ Regularly conduct water

use assessment
+ Identify and implement Kaizens
+ Conduct internal water audits

in rainfall patterns due to climate
change, droughts, and a declining
groundwater table.

To identify the impact on local
community we conducted water needs
assessment studies. Further, using
the comprehensive reports on the
hydrogeological characteristics of the
watershed, water levels in the CGWB
observation wells in the vicinity, and
rainfall predictions for the next 30
years in Utkal, Aditya, Hirakud, and
Renukoot, we have developed water
positivity roadmaps covering specific
interventions to be implemented.

We periodically forecast the cost and
availability of water, to identify potential
demand and supply changes, in view
of future expansion and the impact of
regulatory changes on the operations.
We have estimated that water-related
risks could cost us over $1,084 crore
(%10.84 billion) due to production
disruptions, regulatory water costs, and
compliance expenses.

Water Withdrawal

Water is a scarce resource, and our
approach to sourcing and utilising it

is designed to balance efficiency and
sustainability. About 85% of our water
comes from surface sources, including
harvested rainwater.

Additionally, 6% is sourced from
third-party suppliers and 5% comes

Water Withdrawal (million m?)

from groundwater. The remaining 4%

comes from seawater for which we

integrate desalination. By diversifying
our sources, we enhance resilience,
reduce stress on a single water source,

and ensure responsible extraction,

conservation, and efficient use to
safeguard the resource for future.

In the reporting year, our water
withdrawal was at 92.42 million m3,

of which 83.32 million m? was on
account of Hindalco and 9.10 million m?
on account of Novelis. At the mines,

we withdrew 0.85 million m3, of which
54% was from groundwater, 31% was
from surface water, and 15% was

from rainwater.

Our water withdrawal from water-
stressed areas at Hindalco was 7.03
million m3, which is 8.4% of the total
water withdrawn. Freshwater withdrawn
in water-stress areas accounted for

3.38 million m3, which is 4.3% of the
total water withdrawn. In water stress
areas, 52% of the water withdrawn is

seawater, which is desalinated and used

in the operations.

Water withdrawal from water stress areas (million m*)

The increase in water withdrawal is due
to increase in copper production as
compared to previous year.

Initiatives to reduce water
consumption in water stress areas

Dahej

We took up a project to improve the
health of cooling towers and enhance
the Cycle of Concentration (COC)
parameter. Through this project we
were able to save 300 m’ of fresh water
daily and the water savings amounted to
105,000 m? annually.

Belagavi

We are set to reduce our freshwater
use by approximately 80,000 m*
annually from FY 2026 as we invested
in new rainwater harvesting pond in
the reporting year. Given our current
freshwater withdrawal of 621,344

m® per annum, this initiative would
bring down consumption by around
12.87%. Additionally, we are extending
our efforts beyond the fence through
CSR initiatives by developing lakes

in low-lying areas. These projects

are supported by hydrogeological
studies and driven by active
community engagement.

Asoj

We improved the efficiency of RO
system, resulting in freshwater savings
of 11 m*/hour. We also optimised our
wastewater reuse circuit, which further
reduced freshwater consumption by 6
m*/day.

Kuppam

We spent 741 lakh to set up the
rainwater harvesting system with

five structures and a capacity of
~7,200 KL per annum. Through this
initiative we reduced the dependency
on freshwater sources by ~25% of total
annual consumption.

We launched the Water Neutrality
Project at Mouda in 2019 to address the
region’s growing dependence on the
Kanhan River, aiming to reduce surface
water withdrawal and promote long-
term environmental sustainability. What
distinguishes our initiative is its holistic
and tech-enabled approach.

We constructed two large rainwater
harvesting ponds with a combined
capacity of 130,000 KL and installeda
state-of-the-art ETP incorporating RO,
UF, flocculation, and lamella clarifiers—
effectively establishing a closed-loop
water management system.

Specific Water Consumption

We continuously track progress
towards our target of reducing specific
water consumption by 20% by 2625,
compared to the FY 2018-19 baseline.
In the reporting year, the specific water
consumption for our aluminium and
copper operations stood at 49.96 m7/
MT and 9.43 m3/ MT, respectively.
While calculating the specific water
consumption, we take into account the
water used in the process (measured
through flow meters). This does not
include the losses from evaporation
and percolation.

For Novelis, the water intensity
accounted for 2.42 m/MT of flat-rolled
products, a 10% decrease from the
previous year.

Not a drop lost: Mouda's water saving breakthrough

We further enhanced our infrastructure
with nano water converters, automatic
taps, and sand-carbon filtration
systems to meet the quality standards
for processed water.

Through these efforts, we've achieved
savings of 74 lakh per annum, marking
a significant environmental milestone
for our plant. Our commitment and
innovation have been recognised

with the Cll National Award for

Water Management, positioning
Moudaas a torchbearer for other
downstream plants.

Our Dahej plant lies in a water stress
area and used to earlier withdraw
water from river Narmada. To reduce
dependency on surface water, Gujarat
Industrial Development Corporation
(GIDC) launched acommon
desalination project for industries to
use seawater in their operations. In
2021, Hindalco invested #114 crore
in a desalination project to support
our operations at Dahej. Today, the
desalination project contributes 10
MLD water annually and has reduced
our copper plant’s dependency on
freshwater by 50%.

At Hindalco, we are implementing
certain initiatives to optimise water
use. These include setting up low-flow
fixtures (sensor-based) in restrooms.
We are exploring other solutions

to save water— such as digital
dashboards at Renukoot, Hirakud,
Muri, and ways to recycle water used in
cooling processes.

At Novelis, we implemented multiple water quality enhancement projects across
global operations, reinforcing our commitment to sustainable water management.

Enhancing Water Efficiency at Hirakud Power Plant

We have installed a digital monitoring
system at the Hirakud Power plant

to optimise water management. The
system includes digital flow meters
and sensors which helped create a
centralised water dashboard. This
dashboard, which consolidates

all water-related data including
recirculation of freshwater and
blowdown water lines, helps in quick
decision-making and parameter
correlation, significantly improving
response time and reducing

water loss.

By leveraging this digital tool,

the plant was able to identify and
address leakages effectively and
reduce annual specific freshwater
consumption by 25% — from 2.8 m*/
MWh to 2.1 m3/MWh.

Reusing and Recycling Water, Preserving Resources

In a concerted effort to reduce our
reliance on freshwater sources, we
have enhanced water recycling and
reuse initiatives across our operations,
gardening, and sanitation systems. In
the reporting period, our commitment to
water stewardship resulted in recycling
and reusing 19.09 million m? of water.
This included 17.05 million m? recycled
at our aluminium facilities, achieving
arate of 25.80%, and 2.04 million m
recycled at our copper operations witha
tate of 27.36%.

Our water management strategy
involves utilising recycled water in
processes such as dust suppression,

wheel cleaning, sanitation, and flushing
systems. By treating and repurposing
sewage water, we contribute to
conserving freshwater resources by
using it in cooling towers and sanitation
facilities. Furthermore, our approach
includes providing tertiary treatment

to blowdown from cooling towers and
boilers, effectively recycling it as make-
up water within our operations.

Novelis’ progressive water reuse
practices is showcased at their Ulsan
plant, where an advanced filtration
system has enabled the recycling of
wastewater from the cooling tower ata
rate of 4 million m3 per hour.

Terre Haute Closed-

Loop Water System:
Conservation through
innovation

Earlier, at Novelis’ Terre Haute plant,
we relied ona cooling water system
and consumed groundwater froma
subsurface aquifer. In alignment with
our commitment to environmental
stewardship, we decided to transform
the once-through cooling water
system into a closed-loop water
system, with a water recycling

rate of approximately 90%. The

key enhancements involved the
installation of a new cooling tower,
upgrading the heat exchangers

and integrating essential piping,
infrastructure, and electrical systems
to support the closed-loop operation.
The project will be commissioned in
FY 2025-26, and we anticipate saving
approximately 575,000 m? of water
annually, showcasing our dedication
towards resource conservation

and sustainability.

At Aditya, we launched a water recovery
and conservation project to reclaim
water from the smelter effluent stream.
Previously, this water used to flow to the
ash pond.

Installing a Tertiary Water Recycling

Unit (TWRU), with a capacity of 200
KLD, proved to be a turning paint in
water conservation. Before the unit

had been set up, treated water from the
effluent ETP used to evaporate. With the
implementation of a thermal evaporation

Water conservation at Aditya

system, we now recover and reuse

over 95% of water in our operations.
Additionally, the Mechanical Vapour
Recompression (MVR) system treats
RO reject water and recovers more than
190 KL of water daily from the effluent
stream, significantly enhancing our
water efficiency. These efforts led toa
daily reduction of 180-190m* freshwater
consumption and the complete
elimination of effluent discharge into the
ash pond.

Driving Efficiency:
Enhanced Cooling
Tower Cycles at
Novelis Pinda

To optimise water consumption at
the Pinda plant, we enhanced the
cooling tower cycles in the water
remelt system, a significant step
towards sustainable operations.

As part of the initiative, we introduced
anew chemical component

to the water treatment, which

aimed to reduce the sulphate
concentration and thereby increase
the concentration cycles. Before
applying the chemicals, we conducted
lab testing to validate the efficacy

of the new chemical additives. By
successfully increasing the cycles in
the cooling towers from 2.6 to 3.5, we
achieved a substantial reduction in
water consumption.

Striving for Zero Liquid Discharge

At Hindalco, efficient treatment of effluents and sewage is a major step in our journey towards Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD).
Hindalco India (Subsidiaries) have achieved ZLD, setting the pace for our ongoing efforts across other locations.

Adopting Zero Liquid Discharge: A Transformation at Hindalco Kuppam

Situated in a water-stress region in
Andhra Pradesh, our Kuppam plant
took a transformative step towards
water sustainability by targeting
ZLD. Earlier, effluent from the ETP
was routed to the Common Effluent
Treatment Plant (CETP) and pond
without reuse.

After conducting a rigorous streamwise
effluent evaluation, treatment, and
optimisation, we implemented a ZLD
system of 60 KLD with an investment
of $20 crore. The treated effluent now
passes through a Thermal Evaporation
unit and in this process, only 8-10% of
the water is lost as moisture, while the
remaining is efficiently recycled back
into the operations.

Since commissioning the ZLD
system, freshwater consumption has
reduced by approximately 55 KLD
with estimated reduction of 19,000
m? in annual groundwater withdrawal,
marking a major step forward in our
water circularity efforts.

environmental footprint to ensure
responsible utilisation of resources. We
incorporate circularity in our operations,
maximise resource efficiency

Transforming Waste into Value

At Hindalco, we take a holistic
approach to waste management, not
just reducing waste but transforming
it into valuable resources, reinforcing
our dedication to sustainable
practices. To ensure effective

waste management and regulatory
compliance, we have instituted Waste
Management Taskforce (WaMTF)

at plants. The WaMTF comprises a
leader, a convenor, and other team

and collaborates with stakeholders

to develop and implement waste
disposal strategies. The taskforce
convenes monthly to review waste
management practices, ensuring that
we stay aligned with our commitments
and continue to drive progress.

The Corporate Sustainability team
reviews the progress half yearly.

The taskforce periodically conducts
waste-management training at plants.

At Novelis, our Global Waste
Management Committee, comprising
experts from operations, R&D, and
engineering, guides in advancing

waste reduction strategies. Reporting
to our Global Sustainability Steering

+

+

Failure to comply with waste and tailings management
regulations could result in fines, harm to reputation, and
lead to even operational shutdowns.

We operate 19 TSFs, with three classified as high-risk
and two as significant-risk facilities.

Risks associated with these facilities include dyke
instability, seepage, and failure due to extreme weather
conditions.

Insufficient recycling and refurbishing capacity,
especially in remote areas, can lead to improper
disposal of waste.

Operational delays and waste accumulation may result
in regulatory non-compliance and hurt reputation.

Higher costs for alternative disposal methads can strain
resources.

Challenges in waste management may hinder progress
towards Zero Waste to Landfill (ZWTL) goals.

Improper storage, handling, or leakage of waste could
result in land, air, and water contamination, posing
environmental and health risks.

Pollution concerns may lead to scrutiny from

surrounding communities, potentially affecting trust and
social license to operate.

+ We adhere to all relevant regulatory laws, ensuring full
compliance across operations.

+ Allour tailings storage facilities (TSFs) for bauxite residue (red
mud) comply with GISTM guidelines.

+ We periodically conduct internal audits and stability
assessments through independent geotechnical experts
to moniter the structural integrity of storage dams and
enhance preparedness and mitigation against overtopping or
subsidence risks.

+ We minimise waste by dispatching bauxite residue to cement
plants and rehabilitate the legacy storages.

+ We conduct regular geotechnical evaluations with independent
experts to ensure structural integrity.

+ Weutilise drone surveys and geotechnical monitoring tools,
including piezometers and inclinometers, to provide continuous
oversight of our facilities.

+ 85% of our waste is sent for recycling to authorised recyclers,
pre-processors and co-processors.

+ Weensure 100% compliance with Extended Producer
Responsibility (EPR) regulations for plastic packaging waste,
earning the plastic EPR credits.

+ We continuously invest in RSD initiatives to develop waste-
to-value solutions, including metal recovery, construction
materials, and industrial applications.

+ We follow standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure
safe handling and storage of waste.

+ We conduct periodic audits to uphold compliance and best
practices.

+ We continuously engage with communities to address
concerns and promote awareness.

+ We develop green belts and structural safeguards near storage
areas to mitigate ecological impact.

To further minimise risks, we audit
waste disposal facilities annually.

In the reporting year, five of our plants
— Aditya, Belagavi, Mahan, Muri,
and Renusagar — were certified
Zero Waste to Landfill (ZWTL) bya
third-party. With this achievement, 8
out of 19 of our plants now hold ZWTL
certification, marking significant
progress in our ongoing efforts to
minimise environmental impact.

In addition, we actively invest in
research and development to drive
innovation in waste management.

In the reporting year, we allocated
%30.73 lakh towards waste-related
RSD initiatives and committed
¥448.78 crore in operating expenses
to facilitate the use of bauxite residue,
ash, copper slag, etc.

At Novelis, we are guided by our Waste
Management Performance Standard,
which ensures proper classification,
handling, storage, segregation, and
disposal while maintaining auditing

and compliance protocols. These
standards extend to both our operations
and contractors, reinforced through
annual training and audits. We track
waste data monthly in EtQ management
databases, with quarterly validation

by our corporate EHS team to ensure
accuracy and accountability.

Additionally, our RGD teams are driving
innovation in recycling technologies,
particularly for dross, while our
committee promotes best practices
across operations. In the reporting year,
we reinforced our sustainability efforts
through global training across all plants,
ensuring alignment with our long-term
environmental goals.

To uphold industry best practices, we conduct third-party audits every three years,
complemented by annual corporate audits and regulatory compliance reviews
every four years. Our commitment to sustainability is further demonstrated by our
Pindamonhangaba Plant receiving Zero Waste Certification from the Zero Waste
International Alliance, validating our success in landfill diversion and sustainable

waste practices.

At Hindalco, we are committed to Zero Waste to Landfill (ZWTL) by 2050 and at
Novelis, we have set a target to reduce waste-to-landfill intensity by 20% by 2026

from 2020 baseline.

Waste Generation and Utilisation

At Hindalco, waste generation is a
part of our value chains, emerging
at every stage from raw material

extraction to finished product delivery.

We process bauxite ore and copper
concentrate along with chemicals
and consumables, resulting in bulk,
non-hazardous and hazardous
waste. Our bulk process wastes —
including bauxite residue, fly ash,
spent pot lining (SPL), aluminium
dross, vanadium sludge, and copper
slag — require scientific storage,
reuse, or co-processing to minimise
environmental impact. Meanwhile,
hazardous wastes like ETP sludge,
used oils, fluoride-contaminated
materials, and used anode butts
require handling and disposal through

authorised channels. We also manage
non-hazardous waste, such as scrap
and packaging materials through
recycling initiatives and third-party
collaborations. Additionally, plastic
waste, e-waste, used batteries,
biomedical waste, municipal solid
waste, and construction debris

are processed responsibly within
regulatory frameworks.

At Novelis, our primary waste streams
— dross, salt cake, filter residues,
baghouse dust, and refractory
materials — are managed with a focus
on recovery and reuse. We strive to
produce aluminium alloys with high
downstream recyclability, ensuring a
sustainable lifecycle for our products.

Sustainable Utilisation
of Bauxite Residue in
Road Construction

The alumina manufacturing process
generates significant quantity of
bauxite residue as a byproduct. For
every tonne of alumina produced,
approximately 1.5 to 2 tonnes of this
residue is generated. At Utkal, this
amounts to ~30 lakh MT annually,
leading to vast accumulations of
bauxite residue in designated storage
areas. This waste remained unused
as there were no cement plants in the
remote areas where Utkal is located.

Recognising the need to develop
alternative application and the surging
demand in road construction, we
collaborated with premier research
institutes, such as CSIR-Central
Road Research Institute (CRRI),
CSIR-Institute of Minerals & Materials
Technology (IMMT), and government
authorities like the National Highway
Authority of India (NHAI) and Indian
Road Congress, to explore the
feasibility of using bauxite residue in
road construction. This collaboration
led to the development of a pilot road
near Utkal at Koraput, Odisha.

Through environmental and

health impact assessments and
laboratory testing, we confirmed
that bauxite residue is meeting the
MoRTH & IRC specifications and
can be safely used in subgrade and
embankment construction.

In the reporting year, we successfully
utilised 2.3 lakh MT of bauxite residue
in road construction, transforming
waste into resource, saving the
natural soil, and meeting our
circularity objectives.

Preventing and Managing
Spills

Spills and leaks are a significant
challenge in industrial operations,
something that requires us to be vigilant
and prepared to take swift action. Our
Environmental Aspect-Impact Register
is adedicated system to track and
assess these risks in our plants. Each
risk is documented, and precautionary,
preventive, and control measures are
mentioned in our risk registers. This is
complemented by SOPs, ensuring that
safety is embedded in daily operations.
Additionally, we also have installed
CCTVs at all our various waste storage
and material handling areas.

For spills and leaks during material
transportation outside our premises,
we use fishbone analysis to trace
the root cause — whether packaging
flaws, transportation mishaps, or
procedural gaps — enabling precise
corrective actions.

Once root cause has been identified, we
collaborate with in-house and external
SMEs to take remedial measures in

line with industry best practices. In the
reporting year, there were no spills and
leaks at our plants, mines and facilities,
and during material transportation.

At Novelis, we have a Spill Prevention
Performance Standard for the proper
storage and handling of materials.

Circularity through
recycling focus

At Hindalco, we are pioneering
technological innovation in waste
recycling and reuse, driving a
transformative shift towards
sustainability and circular economy
leadership. Our ambitious expansion of

aluminium recycling facilities — targeting
a growth of 30 KTPA by FY 2026 and
scaling to 200 KTPA by FY 2029 — will
be powered by strategic third-party
tolling arrangements. Simultaneously,
we are harnessing the potential of
domestic and global scrap markets,
establishing a robust, organised network
for sourcing high-quality scrap. As part
of our commitment to sustainability, we
have introduced two new eco-friendly
brands, namely ecoEDGE.G and
ecoEDGE.C. The ecoEDGE.C brand
features products with inputs from
recycled scrap.

In copper operations, we are setting
new benchmarks in recycling efficiency,
aiming to boost our capacity to 50 KTPA
by FY 2025-26 through investments of
US$290 million, and scaling up to 200
KTPA in phases. We are pioneering
afirst-of-its-kind copper and e-waste
recycling, unlocking the potential for
recovering high-value metals such as
gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. Our
cutting-edge process will be capable of
recycling Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)
equivalent to 3 million cell phones
annually, marking a significant step
towards sustainable resource recovery
and demonstrating our commitment
towards urban mining. By championing
innovation and bold initiatives, we
continue to redefine industry standards
and accelerate the global transition toa
more sustainable and circular economy.

Aligned with Novelis’ 3x30 Vision, we
are accelerating efforts to enhance
circularity in our operations. This
vision drives us to push boundaries

on recycled content, aiming for 75%
average recycled aluminium in our
products. Our AL:sust™ brand isa
growing family of innovative low-carbon
aluminum solutions — containing at
least 80% recycled content. Through
strategic investments and industry-
leading innovations, we are reinforcing
our commitment to sustainability

by expanding recycling capabilities,
optimising resource efficiency, and
fostering circular economy.

aluminium manufacturing residues.

We run community-based recycling awareness programmes globally. We also
support STEM education and learning events like Global Safety Week. These

programmes aim to build long-term recycling behaviours and empower future

generations to engage in circular economy practices.

We supported two bipartisan federal recycling bills — the Recycling Infrastructure
and Accessibility Act and the Recycling and Composting Accountability Act —
which have passed the U.S. Senate and await action in the House. If enacted,
these bills will advance aluminum recycling and foster broader circular

economy policies.

Expand closed-
loop recycling
programmes with
customers

We are collaborating with our automotive customers to enhance closed-
loop recycling, as the average automotive stamping process turns 30-40%
of an aluminum coil into scrap. We use this scrap to create new coils, which
can be reused in the manufacturing process and support a more sustainable
supply chain.

ecosystems

Advocate for
recycling policies

At Hindalco’s Copper Business,
Dahej, we generate approximately
320-350 MT/day of ETP Gypsum,
which constitutes 99% of the total
hazardous waste generated at the
plant. In our pursuit of achieving
ZWTL, we partnered with cement
companies, institutions and
pollution control boards to create a
sustainable solution.

Our journey began with obtaining
the necessary permissions and
conducting trial runs, which have

We actively advocate for circularity in the EU, supporting aluminium’s
designation as a strategic material and its inclusion in sustainability regulations.
We collaborate with industry partners on policies like the End-of-Life Vehicle
Regulation to enhance aluminum recycling. Our focus remains on advancing
recycled content and recycling rate targets to drive demand for sustainable
aluminium products.

now been completed. Earlier, ETP
gypsum used to be sent to landfills,
but now, we've transformed it into an
opportunity, redirecting around 400
MT/day of ETP gypsum, including
legacy stock, to cement industries,
where it is utilised in co-processing.

This initiative delivers dual benefits.
For us, it significantly reduces
waste to landfill, aligning with our
commitments to zero waste to
landfill. For cement manufacturers,
it provides a valuable substitute for

natural gypsum, conserving natural
resources and enhancing their
production processes.

Since the start of operations
approximately 1.96 million MT waste
had been directed to eight landfills.
The initiative ends the need for new
landfills which is a huge benefit. By
embracing this approach, we are
fostering a circular economy, turning
waste into a resource and driving a
greener future.

Sustainable
Mining

Our approach to mining is grounded

in our commitment that goes

beyond regulatory compliance.

We strive to strike a harmonious
balance between economic growth,
environmental stewardship, and social
responsibility through continuous
community engagement.

As part of our commitment, we
introduced our first Sustainable

Mining Charter in 2021 — a structured,
actionable framework that aligns with
our three guiding principles and spans
seven thematic areas. This charter
integrates a mine lifecycle approach
and robust risk management strategies
to drive sustainable outcomes at every
stage of operation.

We have a robust governance structure
comprising cross-functional teams

that implement sustainable mining
strategies across various focus areas,
including managing goals, setting
targets, and monitoring progress.

Our Board-level committee regularly
reviews the overall performance. Our
corporate-level sustainable mining
committee oversees planning, resource
allocation, performance review of
mining operations and mine closure
KPIs, training and capacity building,
new technology adoption, and cross-
sector partnerships. This committee
meets monthly and is also responsible
for reviewing closure liabilities including
budget versus cashflows, assessment
of constraints or delays and oversight
of both long-term and concurrent
reclamation. Moreover, our site-level
committee tracks progress, implements
initiatives, engages stakeholders, and
manages the site.

A key focus of our sustainable mining

is responsible land use. Recognising
land as a critical mining resource, we
implemented a dedicated Sustainable
Land Use Framework to manage land
transformation across the mine life
cycle. This framework emphasises
conservation, restoration, rehabilitation,

resettlement, and responsible mine
closure. Our aim is to enhance local
environmental and social infrastructure
while minimising adverse impacts

on natural resources, biodiversity,
livelihood, and cultural heritage.

The framework is built on three strategic approaches, supported by clearly defined
metrics to track and monitor our progress.

+ Sustainable land use across lifecycle + Total land degraded
+ Land enrichment approach + Percent land reclaimed
+ Mine closure approach + Plantation density

In the pre-mining phase, we collect data to create baseline of socio-economic and
environmental parameters including flora, fauna, water bodies and habitats, and
conduct social baseline studies. From this phase to the mine closure, we engage
with stakeholders, including local communities and administrative bodies, on an
ongoing basis.

Our mine closure planning starts at

the pre-mining stage, where we plan
progressive closure activities that are
implemented during the operating
phase. At every stage of the lifecycle, we
continuously collaborate with relevant
stakeholders and conduct reviews in
case of any changes in permits. We
also develop social and economic
transition plans which include closure
strategies for social transition®, creating
opportunities for local communities and
handover of infrastructure.

One of our thematic areas is local
economic development, aimed at
building an integrated, equitable, and
sustainable growth model that creates
synergistic and symbiotic socio-
economic value for the community. We
promote this through our 3C strategy
of Communication, Collaboration,

and Consultation. This helps us
identify community needs, conduct
socio-economic and environmental
baseline studies and prioritise short-
and long-term goals. In addition,

we communicate transparently

about the mine's development plan
and potential positive and negative
impacts. We also consult with the
communities to develop programmes
and mine closure management

plans, ensuring they are inclusive

and responsive to regional needs.
These plans address a broad range

of focus areas, including mine design
and engineering, employee relations,
socio-economic development,
rehabilitation and remediation, post-
mined landscapes, future land use, and
biodiversity conservation.

Through our integrated development
strategy, we create sustainable
livelihoods, improve employability,
ensure access to education, healthcare
and other basic amenities, enable
inclusive social change, develop
resilient infrastructure, and promote
regional progress.

5 The International Council on Mining and Metals
((CMM) recommends using the term ‘social
transition’ in place of the more commonly used
‘social closure’ due to the latter’s negative
connotations.

To ensure that our local development programmes are inclusive and sustainable, we

adopt an end-to-end design approach that starts with stakeholder consultation and
extends through impact assessment of interventions and reporting.

At Hindalco, we have been allocated 25
mines, out of which Kathautia, Chakla,
Hisri Old, Meenakshi, and Meenakshi
West are non-operational. All our mines
have closure and rehabilitation plans

in place. These plans are approved by
the relevant authorities and reviewed

at regular intervals. Each mine has a
set performance target, developed in
consultation with key stakeholders.

Our rehabilitation strategy aims to
amplify environmental and socio-
economic value by sustainably
managing post-mining land use. Our
circular approach entails repurposing
overburden dumps to backfill mined-
out areas and carefully store the
topsoil for future land rehabilitation.
This structured approach ensures
that our mining footprint is balanced.
Currently, our ratio of land disturbed
to land rehabilitated stands at 1:0.8,
reflecting our focus on sustainable
resource management.

Allour mines have emergency
management plans which outline
potential hazards and necessary
responses with clearly defined roles and
responsibilities. These plans are tested
monthly for effectiveness. We also have
astructured mechanism to identify
critical incidents based on intensity and
resource availability.

We have a divestment mechanism,
which plays a crucial role in

ensuring that responsibilities are not
abandoned when the ownership of

the mine changes. Our disinvestment
mechanism ensures that financial and
legal liabilities are fully transferred,
with the purchaser accepting complete

Our divestment framework includes the following key components:

responsibility for mine closure,
reclamation, and post-closure
monitoring. This process includes the
transfer of allocated closure funds or
financial sureties — such as escrow
accounts or bank guarantees — which
the purchaser assumes to meet for all
closure and reclamation obligations.
Legal safeguards are also put in place
to protect us from future liabilities

and to ensure that all agreed-upon
environmental and social commitments
are fulfilled. Additionally, regulatory
oversight plays a key role in confirming
that closure plans are regularly updated,
financially supported, and legally
binding on the new operator.

Formal agreement

Biodiversity Management

At Hindalco, we recognise
that business and nature
are intrinsically linked. Our
operations rely on thriving
ecosystems, and, in return,
we have a responsibility to
minimise our impact on them.
AS we grow, nature remains
at the heart of our approach,
guiding us to reduce our
footprint while promoting the
responsible use of natural
resources.

Through innovation, collaboration, and
proactive biodiversity management, we
strive to balance resource development
with ecosystem preservation, working
closely with stakeholders to safeguard
biodiversity in and around our areas

Our Impacts and Dependencies

As ametals and mining company, we
depend heavily on ecosystem services
and acknowledge that our operations
have an impact on nature. In our
inaugural report aligned with the TNFD
disclosures, we identified our nature-
related impacts and dependencies
using TNFD’s Locate-Evaluate-Assess-
Prepare (LEAP) nature risk assessment
approach. For this, we employed tools
such as ENCORE, WRI Aqueduct 3.0,
STAR-R, and IBAT. Using ENCORE, we
identified impacts and dependencies

at the sector level and further analysed
their relevance to our operations.

Nature-related impacts

Our industry inherently interacts with
the environment in multiple ways. The
extraction of minerals, metals, and fossil
fuels demands large-scale operations
that directly affect land, water, soil, and
air quality. One impact is the disruption
of terrestrial ecosystems caused by
mining and infrastructure development,
often resulting in habitat destruction
and fragmentation.

Water is another essential resource
critical to our operations. Our processes
place significant demand on local water

sources, especially in regions already
experiencing scarcity. If effluent discharge
quality is not maintained, it may pollute
nearby water bodies and affect the
aquatic ecosystems and communities
that rely on the resource.

Our operations also contribute to
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and
other pollutants, which can degrade air
quality and accelerate climate change.
Additionally, if not appropriately treated,
the disposal of mining residues and other
waste in landfills can negatively impact
the soil quality.

Furthermore, we rely on regulating
ecosystem services to maintain

healthy environments. These include
services that purify air and water,
regulate climate, and mitigate natural
hazards. As ecosystems degrade, these
services diminish, posing risks to the
environment, operational efficiency, and
long-term sustainability.

We have also identified impacts and dependencies at the site level. The details are
available in our Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures Report 2024.

Biodiversity risk
management process

Biodiversity risk assessment is integrated
into our ERM framework, ensuring that
environmental stewardship is embedded
into our decision-making processes. By
integrating biodiversity considerations into
our ERM framework, we adopt a proactive
and forward-thinking approach, identifying,
mitigating, and addressing risks before
they escalate.

Our risk management process follows
four key steps and accounts for risks
related to impacts and dependencies. We
conduct biodiversity risk assessments
not only for our own operations but also

for our downstream activities —including
outsourced operations — and the areas

surrounding our operating sites. In the initial

stage, we conduct biodiversity screenings
at our operational sites to assess potential
impacts on surrounding habitats. This
includes identifying key biodiversity areas
(KBAs) and protected areas (PAs) using
the IBAT tool. We then categorise each
site as high, medium or low based on the
presence of KBAs and PAs — particularly
those that include Rare, Endangered, and
Threatened (RET) species. Our focus
remains on high-priority sites with crucial
biodiversity within a 10 km buffer zone and
on medium-priority sites with RET species
inthe same radius.

Conservation and restoration of biodiversity

AS part of our commitment to
ecosystem restoration and invasive
species management, we consistently
undertake afforestation and
reforestation activities in and around
operating sites. Using the Miyawaki
plantation technique, we have

planted around 5.33 lakh trees in the
reporting year.

We are about to start a community-led
mangrove plantation project in Bharuch,
Gujarat. This initiative will cover a
§0-hectare area with native mangrove
species — Avicennia Marina — with
adensity of 2500 per hectare. The
proposed land is around 26 km from our
Dahej plant and is a government-owned
unserved revenue land with mudflats and
no vegetation. The project will begin with
forming a committee, conducting training
and capacity building for the locals,
planting trees, and maintaining the site.

At our Belagavi plant, we conducted a
three-season study during FY 2023-24.
Akey recommendation from the BMP
is to develop off-site habitats covering

106.3 hectares at the site and around
the buffer zone. To initiate this habitat
development project, we engaged

a third-party expert to analyse the
recommendations and assess the buffer
zones for suitable habitat restoration.
The assessment involved a preliminary
survey (including desktop and site
assessments), a feasibility analysis,
and a multi-criteria decision analysis

to evaluate potential implementation
strategies. The study was completed

in the reporting year, and we plan to
implement the project in FY 2025-26.

Restoration of Native Flora at Renukoot

We conducted a pilot ecological
restoration project on a two-acre

land parcel at Renukoot, focusing

on removing invasive species and
revitalising native biodiversity. Through
this initiative, Leucaena leucocephala
(Subabul), an aggressive invasive
species, was systematically removed to
create space for indigenous vegetation.
In its place, we planted 2,000 saplings
of native species — Pongamia pinnata,

Neem, and Tecoma stans — to help
restore the ecological balance.

To support long-term health of the newly
introduced vegetation, we developed
anin-house vermicompost system to
supply organic nutrients that enhance
soil fertility and plant growth. We also
installed a water pipeline for irrigation
and established a dedicated watch ward
system to ensure continuous oversight
and protection of the plantation.

These proactive measures have
resulted ina 98% survival rate of

the planted saplings, reinforcing the
project's success. This integrated
approach — combining ecological
intervention, sustainability practices,
and continuous monitoring — has
significantly improved biodiversity and
ecosystem health.

Live and Let Live: Biodiversity initiatives at Aditya Aluminium, Odisha

Groundbreaking ecological

initiatives are bringing about a green
transformation at Aditya. We’ve planted
over 8 lakh saplings, developed 33% of
our land into green belts, created a 20-
acre Biodiversity Park at the plant.

At the heart of this journey is our own
seasoned horticulture and biodiversity
expert, fondly recognised as the
"Green Architect of Aditya." Under his
leadership, we’ve elevated our focus
from regulatory compliance to true
conservation excellence.

Many of our efforts align with IUCN—
BMP recommendations, including:

+ Developing an 8,000 sq.m Butterfly
Garden with carefully curated nectar
and host plants

+ Creating dedicated habitats for
reptiles and ecological niches for
mammals within our premises

+ Launching a restoration drive for
IUCN Red List plant species native
to the Sambalpur region

+ Introducing the Miyawaki plantation
technique, a first not just for
Hindalco, but across the Aditya
Birla Group

+ Implementing bird conservation
measures that have seen the return
of migratory species

+ Advancing our journey towards
water positivity

+ Establishing a 20-acre Biodiversity
Park within Aditya Township, which
now thrives as a habitat for diverse
flora and fauna

In our pursuit of No Net Loss of
Biodiversity, we've gone beyond our
boundaries — carrying out afforestation
across 144 acres of degraded forest
land allocated by the Government

of Odisha.

CSR Governance

Our CSR Policy is the foundation of
our community efforts. This policy
outlines how we plan, execute,

and monitor CSR projects in

line with our core principles and
regulatory requirements.

Guided by this policy, our CSR
strategy focuses on addressing the
real needs of local communities. We
use several methods to identify these
needs, including baseline surveys

by external agencies, field visits, and
consultations with villagers, panchayat
members, self-help groups (SHGs),
village-level institutions, NGOs and
community-based organisations
(CBOs), government officials, and
media representatives. We also

seek collaborations with other
industries and stakeholders to amplify
our impact.

Furthermore, an Apex Grievance Redressal Committee is in place to review
community grievances, monitor budget allocations, and ensure that projects are
implemented effectively. During the reporting period, we strengthened our internal

CSR governance framework.

Community Consultation and
Engagement Process

We identify peripheral communities
(including affected communities at new
plants and mines) and stakeholders

to ensure inclusivity and meaningful
engagement. By understanding the
perspectives of those involved, we lay
the foundation for effective consultation
and collaboration. Our community
consultation and engagement process
is applicable across all our locations.

An initiative to raise the financial literacy of women in Kathautiya

Communities are encouraged to
share their views on operational

and project risks, cultural heritage
preservation, and environmental and
social impacts, including proposed
mitigation measures. Their inputs
inform operational and project-
related decisions to ensure alignment
with local needs and aspirations.
Grievance mechanisms are in place
across sites to address concerns
promptly and transparently, reinforcing
trust. Further, all our locations have
respective consultation committees,
including occupational health and
safety committee.

We implement structured stakeholder
engagement plans to ensure all
interactions are effective and impactful.
Communities are empowered through
access to relevant information and
encouraged to participate actively

in consultations. Regular reporting
mechanisms are in place to keep
stakeholders informed, fostering
transparency throughout the process.

At Hindalco India, we conduct
community consultations across all
current production assets. We have 19
plants and 25 mines of which two mines
were allocated in FY 2024-25 and were
not operational in the reporting period.
Of our six development programmes,
two are actively undergoing community
consultations. Additionally, at Novelis,
community consultation takes place
across all 31 of our sites. Our Novelis
operations also have one community
development programme for the Bay
Minette site, and it is in the process

of community consultations with

local stakeholders.

All major Novelis operational sites have
formalised community engagement
processes customised to the needs
and expectations of local stakeholders.
At Novelis, we hold ourselves to high
internal standards for community
engagement, further supported

by a comprehensive Environment,
Health, and Safety (EHS) programme
across operations.

Community Grievance
Redressal Mechanism

Our grievance redressal mechanism
reflects our commitment to
transparency, trust, and ongoing
collaboration with all the communities
around our operations. We maintain
regular dialogue with them through
needs assessments, community
meetings, satisfaction surveys,
training programmes, and workshops.

To ensure accountability, we
communicate our progress and
performance regularly via CSR
reports, newsletters, magazines,
mass media publications, and
social audits. Each unit’s CSR team
leads this process supported bya
structured system to receive and
resolve complaints whether shared
through field visits, letters, phone
calls, WhatsApp, or SMS.

A dedicated Grievance Cell supported
by an Apex Committee manages the
entire resolution process. Grievances
can be submitted in person either at
the Grievance Cell on specific days or
directly to the Lead-CSR.

The Cell reviews complaints, oversees
investigations, approves responses,
and ensures feedback is provided.

It includes members from HR, CSR,
Environment, Legal, Security, Admin,
PR, and other departments as
required. All cases are documented in
a register capturing the complainant's
details, submission date, issue, and
current status.

The Apex Grievance Redressal
Committee, comprising the Unit
Head, Unit HR Head, Unit EHS
Head, and Unit Legal Head, reviews
significant issues quarterly to ensure
consistent oversight.

We pay special attention to the voices
of marginalised groups, including

the particularly vulnerable, women,
and low-income families within our
operational areas. Our grievance
mechanism is designed to empower

these communities to raise concerns,
especially around environmental or
employment-related issues.

At our Novelis sites, we maintain
accessible and culturally sensitive
channels to hear and address
community concerns, ensuring
alignment with local regulations and
customs. We actively monitor emerging
issues and empower local leadership to
act quickly on concerns brought forth by
community stakeholders.

During the reporting period, we received
no grievances from local communities
across our Hindalco India operations.

Protecting Indigenous
Communities

At Hindalco, we are dedicated to
safeguarding indigenous communities near
our operations, ensuring their rehabilitation
and resettlement. Our Rehabilitation,
Resettlement, and Protection of Indigenous

People Policy is aligned with the National
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy,
supporting sustainable development
and enhancing our reputation as a
responsible organisation.

We adhere to the principle of Free, Prior,
and Informed Consent (FPIC) ensuring
transparent engagement with indigenous
communities and alignment with UN

best practices. We engage in good faith
negotiation, informed consultation, and
equal participation of affected indigenous
communities. We are committed to
preventing forced displacement and
respecting their rights to maintain and
protect their cultural heritage — including
archaeological sites, artefacts, ceremonies,
and artistic traditions from any adverse
impacts of our activities.

Identifying indigenous persons and
communities likely to be affected by
our operations is a critical first step in
our engagement process. We conduct
baseline studies of all project activities
to understand the local context which
informs the development of tailored,
culturally-sensitive engagement plans.

Displacement eligibility and entitlements
are disclosed in the planning phase, and
fair compensation for land acquisition

is determined through our assessment.
As apractice, we avoid acquiring land
that may lead to physical or economic
displacement. If such land acquisition

is necessary, we prepare Resettlement
Action Plans for physically displaced
persons and Livelihood Restoration Plans
for those economically displaced. We
commit to complying with national laws
and international human rights standards
on rehabilitation and resettlement. Audits
and assessments are conducted for
identified resettlement and relocation
cases, to identify negative impacts, and to
ensure that the rights, interests, culture,
traditions, and perspectives of indigenous
people are respected and protected.

Public consultations are initiated through
focused group discussions with the local
communities. A participatory approach
ensures inclusivity, engaging community
members, leaders, indigenous groups,
civil society organisations, and local
authorities in programme development.
Open dialogue helps surface

mutual trust. Participatory rural appraisal
empowers communities by involving
them in identifying issues, implementing
solutions, and monitoring progress.

For instance, we actively engage with
indigenous local communities at GP IV/4
Coal Mines and Samri Bauxite Mines.
The Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) for Samri Bauxite Mines confirms
our adherence to FPIC. Our EIA document
comprehensively addresses socio-
economic impacts, including effects

on human settlements, employment
generation, civic infrastructure, and
broader economic dynamics.

As part of our post-mining responsibilities
we respond to requests for reclaimed
land, employment opportunities, and CSR
initiatives. These include the creation of
ponds, sapling plantations, access to
drinking water, health camps, education,
agriculture, livelinood, sports, art and rural
development. Subsequently, we develop
mine closure plans and rehabilitation
strategies, approved by relevant authorities
for our 23 mines. Rehabilitation plans

and activities are internally assessed and

expectations, address concerns, and build audited periodically,

At Gurdari Bauxite Mines in Gumla,
Jharkhand, we have developed a
community engagement plan to
safeguard the rights of local people
to land and resources. This plan
addresses health, safety, human
rights, and environmental impacts
through CSR interventions. The key
steps for project implementation
include needs assessment, resource
allocation, implementation, and
monitoring. In FY 2024-25, our
CSR efforts covered 10 villages in
Gurdari Panchayat, Bishunpur, and
Chainpur Block, benefiting over
4,706 people and 880 households.
Additionally, our compliance report
outlines environmental measures
such as reclamation plans, land use,
green belt development, pollution

control, waste management, and
resource conservation.

Grievance redressal is facilitated through
multiple channels, allowing communities
to directly report issues to the RDO

or Mines Manager. Depending on the
grievance, resolution may involve
mediation, negotiation, corrective action,
or compensation. All grievances raised
by indigenous people are reviewed by the
District Administration, ensuring they
are recorded, investigated, and resolved
promptly. Our transparent grievance
mechanism allows community members
to voice concerns freely with a particular
focus on ensuring prompt resolution

of all grievances related to physical

and economic displacement.

Community Risk Management

Safeguarding local communities by
minimising adverse operational impacts
is a priority for us at Hindalco. We follow
acomprehensive risk management
approach, through our robust Enterprise
Risk Assessment Process which
identifies and mitigates social and
environmental risks. A structured

risk matrix is used at each location

to assess site-specific risks. Action
plans are developed for ‘red’ and
‘amber’ risks, while ‘green’ risks are
regularly monitored.

Key community risks for our operations
include air and noise pollution, damaged
roads, limited access to health care

and drinking water, poor education
infrastructure, low student-teacher
ratios, and insufficient local livelihood
opportunities. These risks are
monitored through the Enterprise Risk
Management Tool (CURA), which
maintains a tracker with start dates,
action plans, and completion dates.
Quarterly reviews are conducted at both
the unit and corporate levels - led by the
Unit Head locally, and by the Corporate

Risk Manager and Managing Director
at the corporate level —to ensure timely
mitigation and accountability.

Mining operations can pose health and
safety risks to surrounding communities.
Key health impacts include air pollution from
dust and toxic emissions, water pollution
from contaminants and acid mine drainage,
noise pollution, and occupational health
hazards. Safety risks include accidents
and injuries, structural damage from
blasting, chemical spills, and tailings dam
failures. We mitigate these through regular
environmental monitoring, community
health programmes, engineering controls,
and strict regulatory compliance.

We build local capacity through training
programmes in partnerships with
NGOs and maintain transparency via
regular monitoring and public reporting.
Community risks are further addressed
by ensuring our business partners

meet our internal standards, including
conducting Social Impact Assessments
(SIAs), stakeholder consultations, and
participatory planning.

Community Development Agreements
(CDAs) and investments in local
infrastructure, health, education, and
businesses deliver tangible benefits.
Business partners are trained on
stakeholder engagement, contribute to
community projects, and report on their
impact. Our risk framework aligns with
IFC Performance Standards, supporting
sustainable development and enhancing
our reputation as a responsible business.

Community Investments

Our community development projects
enhance quality of life, drive economic
growth, build capacity, and foster
social empowerment and behavioural
change. While challenges such as
dependency, unequal participation,
resistance to change, environmental
stress, and political dynamics may arise,
we proactively anticipate and manage
these risks to ensure meaningful and
sustained impact.

At Novelis, we are committed to improving
the quality of life in the communities where
we operate and in society at large. Our
Corporate Social Responsibility mission
guides our efforts to make a lasting impact
beyond our business. Through our global

initiative, Novelis Neighbour, we sponsor
and coordinate community engagement
and charitable investments around the
world. As part of this effort, our employees
support hundreds of community projects
throughout the year. These initiatives
reflect our purpose of Shaping a
Sustainable World Together, with a strong
focus on advancing STEM education,
encouraging consumer recycling, and
addressing the most pressing needs of
the communities we serve.

We invested 2160.99 crore in
community development projects
across Hindalco India (Standalone)
and Hindalco India (Subsidiaries).

At our standalone operations,

364.33 crore was utilised towards
both ongoing projects and other

Strengthening
Recycling and
Community
Development Through
the Habitat for
Humanity Affiliate
Challenge at Novelis

Declining aluminium recycling rates
inthe US and Canada, highlight

the need for stronger initiatives

to reverse the trend and drive
sustainable impact. To tackle this,
we collaborated with Habitat for
Humanity affiliates to integrate
recycling efforts into their community
outreach, creating a positive impact
on people, planet, and profit.

Through grant support, affiliates
were empowered to promote
aluminium recycling community
campaigns, which also generates
sustainable funding for affordable
housing projects due to the value of
infinitely recyclable aluminum. By
embedding recycling efforts within
local programmes, the initiative
encourages long-term environmental
responsibility and strengthens
community awareness and action,
driving higher recycling rates.

The Novelis-sponsored grant
programme has also attracted

new partners and supporters for
local Habitat affiliates through the
establishment of these community-
wide recycling campaigns.

In its fourth year (2024), the
programme saw record engagement
and growing enthusiasm among
Habitat affiliates. Increased recycling
adoption is providing a growing

and sustainable funding source for
affordable housing efforts. Novelis
and Habitat have established
platforms to allow affiliates to share
best practices and are committed

to inviting feedback to maximise the
financial, environmental, and social
impacts of the grant programme.

Advancing STEM and Aluminium Recycling Through
the CanBot Collaboration at Novelis

As part of Novelis’ purpose of Shaping
a Sustainable World Together, we
actively partner with stakeholders,
inclusive of our customers, to amplify
social impact. As mutual supporters
of FIRST®, a global NGO focused

on inspiring the next generation

of technical and business leaders
through robotics programmes,

we partnered with customer Ball
Corporation to introduce the CanBot
grant programme.

AS part of the programme FIRST
Robotics Challenge (FRC teams)

can apply for a US$5,000 grant to
design and build a robot they can take
into their communities and to FIRST
competitions to champion both STEM
and recycling. The robots designed by
the teams have recycling technologies
such as sorting or can-crushing to
make recycling fun and useful for its

audiences. In turn, these CanBot
projects strengthened robotics
expertise, encouraged hands-on
learning, and expanded recycling
efforts, reinforcing sustainability
among future innovators.

In 2024, 10 additional teams received
grants, broadening outreach beyond
existing operational areas. Increased
funding supported underfunded
teams in robotics tournaments,
ensuring greater accessibility. The
programme also fostered diversity,
with higher participation among
minorities and girls, helping create an
inclusive and dynamic platform for
the next generation of STEM leaders

committed to environmental progress.

Sustainable Livelihood and Social Change

1 \ Sustainable livelinoods play a crucial role in driving economic stability and advancing social

progress within communities. By equipping individuals with the skills and resources needed for
self-sufficiency, we aim to create lasting positive change. Our training programmes in agriculture,
‘ g ' organic farming, orchard development, agri-input support, skilling, entrepreneurship development
, etc. has benefitted 1,81,786 people. This has bolstered their economic stability, elevated their
’ social status, and enabled active involvement in decision-making, thereby enhancing the overall

Unnati: Empowering Farmers through Organic Farming

The Unnati initiative marks a
significant step in promoting
sustainable agriculture and
strengthening rural livelinoods. The
project encourages organic farming
and aims to reduce farmers’ reliance
on chemical fertilisers and pesticides.
Spanning the Dudhi, Muirpur, and
Babhani blocks in Uttar Pradesh,
the project has so far helped 4,401
farmers. Of these, 3,318 received
training and awareness support and
437 farmers were able to improve
practices in vegetable cultivation.

A total of 310 benefited from

experts advise and quality seeds to
significantly boost paddy cultivation
across 678 acres of land.

In FY 2024-25, 892 farmers applied
170 MT of organic manure across
875 acres of land, enhancing soil
health and ensuring safer, healthier
produce. To address water scarcity in
the 3 blocks, 27 lift irrigation systems
were installed to help 256 farmers to
water 426 acres of land. Additionally,
80 farmers benefited from water
conservation structures, bringing 115
acres of farmland under irrigation.

The project also enabled forward
market linkages, helping farmers to
access better markets and reduce
dependence on intermediaries.

As aresult, farmers reported increased
yields, lower input costs, and improved
produce quality, leading to higher
incomes and better living standards.

Empowering Youth through Aditya Birla Skills Centre

In Hirakud of Sambalpur district and
nearby villages, limited access to
vocational training and development
opportunities had long constrained
youth employability. To address

this gap, Hindalco Jana-Seva Trust
launched the Aditya Birla Skills Centre
at Baraipali Chowk, Sambalpur. The
initiative focuses on equipping young
individuals with practical skills and
fostering entrepreneurship.

The centre offers vocational
training across multiple domains,
complemented by holistic
development sessions that prepare
students for long-term, sustainable
employment. An extensive
outreach campaign engaged more
than 700 households, ensuring
strong community participation
and awareness.

Encouraged by its early success, we
plan to replicate this model in Dahej

and Tikri, expanding its impact. As
of now, 205 students are enrolled
in various courses, with 65 already
securing stable jobs and earning
monthly salaries between ¥13,500
and ¥18,750.

By equipping youth with in-demand
skills and creating pathways to
employment, the Skills Centre is
driving economic empowerment
and fostering career resilience in
the region.

Rejuvenation of Kosa Silk in Chhattisgarh

The artisans of Raigarh and

Champa districts faced declining
engagement, limited design
innovation, and inadequate market
access, threatening the sustainability
of Kosa silk, a craft deeply rooted in
the region’s cultural and economic
heritage. To address these challenges,
we established the ‘Kosala Livelihood
§& Social Foundation’ in 2021,
implementing a systems-based
approach to restore the Kosa silk
value chain.

This initiative introduced
contemporary designs and product
innovations, developed essential
infrastructure to support ancillary
activities, and established urban
market linkages to connect
artisans directly with buyers.
Awareness campaigns highlighted
the unique heritage of Kosa silk,
enhancing market visibility and
consumer interest.

As aresult, weaver incomes increased
by 55% compared to the 2021
baseline, with 30 weaver households
securing full-time employment
through Kosala. Improved market
access and fresh designs revitalised
artisan engagement, ensuring
long-term sustainability for Kosa

silk craftsmanship.

Project WADI at Utkal

Tribal farmers in Kashipur, Odisha,
faced economic instability due

to traditional farming on barren,
undulating land, poor irrigation, and
inconsistent rainfall, while landless
families depended on daily wages
and migration for survival. To address
these challenges, Utkal Alumina
International Limited, in partnership
with NABARD, implemented Project
Wadi, establishing 424 acres of fruit
orchards and 76 goat-rearing units
across 17 villages.

Farmers gained access to solar-
powered irrigation, intercrop
cultivation, and comprehensive
skill-building programmes, while
village committees and producer
companies strengthened market
linkages and financial inclusion. An
impact study highlighted significant
economic improvements, with
increased income, reduced migration,
and widespread adoption of modern
farming techniques, as 32% of
beneficiaries earned over ¥50,000,
24% between %20,000-750,000, and
30% between 7400-%20,000 over five
years, while 14% utilised intercropping
primarily for household consumption.
Recognised with NABARD’s Best
Farmers Award (2025), Project

Wadi has successfully transformed
livelihoods, ensuring long-term
sustainability and resilience.

Employee Volunteering
Initiatives

Employees are provided with numerous
opportunities to volunteer for CSR
initiatives. Participation in CSR activities

is encouraged and recognised through
internal platforms. In the reporting

period, 2,455 employees collectively
volunteered 7,529 hours at Hindalco India,
significantly impacting the communities
we serve. These initiatives foster a sense
of community and purpose among,
employees while contributing to the overall
well-being of people and development of
the areas in which we operate. By engaging
in various projects such as environmental

conservation and educational support,
employees drive positive change and build
stronger communities.

Furthermore, in FY 2024-25, we proudly
celebrated the 13th year of our Annual
Global Volunteer Month at Novelis.

This initiative highlights our year-round
commitment to volunteerism, with each
major site organising a variety of volunteer
opportunities throughout October for
colleagues to actively participate in.

Responsible
Value Chain

Committed to fostering a responsible value
chain, we hold our suppliers accountable
through a robust framework built on
transparency and the highest ethical
standards. Our focus on sustainable
procurement is underscored by the
implementation of three key policies:
Novelis Supplier Code of Conduct,
Hindalco Supplier Code of Conduct, and
the Responsible Supply Chain Policy.

Our Supplier Code of Conduct integrates
global best practices, encompassing
health and safety, environmental
stewardship, human rights, and ethical
business conduct. This framework
promotes sustainable business practices
across our value chain. We mandate

that all suppliers, vendors, contractors,
consultants, agents, and other service
providers adhere to its provisions. Our
sustainable sourcing procedures ensure
compliance with government regulations
and International Labour Organisation
(ILO) standards. Furthermore, our vendor
agreements explicitly include human rights
requirements, and we encourage suppliers
to maintain safe and inclusive workplaces.

At Hindalco, we proactively motivate

our suppliers to enhance their ESG
performance. Each value chain partner
is dedicated to maintaining our ESG
values and principles. Our Board of
Directors oversee the supply chain ESG
strategy and related initiatives. To further
this commitment, we have established
aspecialised taskforce comprising
internal team members and executive
management leaders. This taskforce plays
acritical role in ensuring the resilience
and long-term viability of our supply chain
by owning and continuously refining the
sustainable sourcing practices. Charged
with identifying and addressing emerging

supplier and supply chain risks, the
taskforce actively monitors the dynamic
risk landscape to enhance the framework’s
robustness. This proactive approach not
only strengthens our governance practices
but also ensures that sustainability
remains a core component of supplier
lifecycle assessment. Ina time when
adaptability and sustainability are vital for
organisational survival, the taskforce's
work is essential to building a more secure,
transparent, and future-ready supply chain.

Understanding Our Supplier
Network

Our extensive supplier network spans
multiple geographies, with a significant
proportion of suppliers from India,
followed by Singapore, Switzerland, and
Chile. During the reporting period, there
were 29,521 tier-1 suppliers at Hindalco
India and Novelis. Out of this, Hindalco
India had 12,947 tier-1 suppliers and 142
were considered significant. Further,
Novelis had 16,574 tier-1 suppliers out of
which 2,568 were considered significant.

INFY 2024-25, the combined procurement
spend by Hindalco India and Novelis was
¥186,750 crore. Of this, Novelis spent
%120,017 crore (US$14.2 billion). Hindalco
India's total procurement expenditure was
%66,733 crore, with 17,989 crore spent on
account of Indian suppliers and 748,744
crore spent on account of international
suppliers. During the reporting period,
coal procurement accounted for 10% of
Hindalco India’s total procurement spend.

Our operations depend on a robust
supplier network, ensuring the timely
procurement of essential raw materials

for seamless production and market
delivery. To strengthen this ecosystem, we
classify our ‘significant suppliers’ based
on business volume, dependency, impact,
continuity, relevance, and ESG impacts.

Non-Tier 1 Suppliers

We emphasise responsible sourcing
throughout our operations, with
processes specifically designed to
uphold and support these practices.

At Hindalco India, we sourced 27% of
our materials from India, of which 8%
was procured from Micro, Small, and
Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and small

producers. In the previous year, 29%
of our input materials came from India,
including 7.4% directly from MSMEs
and small enterprises. Specifically for
Hindalco’s mine sites, the spending on
the sourcing from the local proximate
supplier was ~ 5% of the overall spend.

Supplier Screening and Onboarding

To ensure a resilient and ethical supply
chain, we have implemented a thorough
and systematic process, designed to
identify and mitigate risks promptly and
screen and onboard suppliers. Before
establishing any business relationship,
we conduct a detailed risk assessment,
evaluating their financial stability and
assessing the quality of their products
or services. An onboarding assessment
helps us in ensuring that the suppliers
comply with all applicable rules and
regulations, including the payment of
statutory dues.

Furthermore, we examine the
sustainability practices of our suppliers
across ESG criteria, recognising their
relevance to our business needs. This
comprehensive evaluation helps us
understand the broader impact of
suppliers’ operations. We consider various
risks associated with the sector, country,

cr

and commodity during the screening

of significant suppliers, ensuring a
thorough assessment. The onboarding
evaluation consists of capability, statutory,
environment, social and governance
checks and also requires the vendors to be
compliant to Hindalco’s Supplier Code of
Conduct which focuses on the requirement
of sustainability in supply chain, business
conduct principles, anti-bribery, diversity,
labour and human rights, safe and healthy
working conditions, environmental

and statutory compliances, CAHRA
sourcing compliance for conflict mineral
and ensuring our vendors maintains the
same standards in their supply chain. In
the reporting period, all new suppliers

at Hindalco underwent this Supplier
Screening Process. Additionally, all tier

1 suppliers are covered by the supplier
screening process including significant tier
1 suppliers.

To be eligible for tenders or contracts,
suppliers must meet our stringent
ESG standards. Our procurement
team continuously reviews purchasing
practices to ensure alignment with
our Supplier Code of Conduct

and to avoid potential conflicts

with ESG requirements. Suppliers
who demonstrate superior ESG
performance are given preference
during the selection and contract
awarding process.

Our dedicated teams are equipped
with the necessary tools to assess
ESG compliance throughout the
onboarding, engagement, and audit
phases. This ensures responsible
sourcing practices and upholds our
commitment to ethical business
procedures and environmental
stewardship. Our comprehensive
process ensures that 100% of our
inputs are procured sustainably.

Supplier Assessment

Supplier assessments are crucial

for ensuring operational efficiency,
risk mitigation, and overall business
success. Our Supplier Performance
and Risk Assessment framework is a
key tool for evaluating and managing
suppliers. This framework comprises
several components focused on
understanding, mitigating, and
aligning supplier practices with our
organisation’s values and objectives.

We categorise suppliers based on the
criticality of their goods or services to
our operations. The three categories
are ‘Significant’, ‘Medium’, and ‘Low’
dependency. Significant suppliers
undergo more rigorous physical
assessments by an independent audit
team. The assessment is curated
based on the type of supplier, e.g.
Manufacturer, Trader, Service Provider,
Transporter, Authorised Dealer etc.
The significant supplier is assessed
based on capability, performance,
environment, health, social and
sustainability aspect based on the
evidentiary document.

The result of this assessment is

a supplier risk rating along with
recommended corrective actions.
Suppliers receive full support
throughout the process of addressing
these actions and are closely monitored
until they are resolved. Failure to
complete corrective actions can affect
the business relationship with the
supplier. This tiered approach ensures
that resources are allocated based on
risk and impact.

Assessments encompass internal desk
reviews, self-assessments, and on-site
evaluations conducted by contracted
consultants or independent accredited
auditors, wherever applicable.

These assessments cover financial
stability checks, operational audits,
performance reviews, and sustainability
assessments. All assessments adhere
to national and international guidelines,
regulatory requirements, and standards
set by global agencies such as the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD), IMS, and the
United Nations (UN) standards.

We assess environmental and

social criteria including safety
certification, emergency response
plans, safety training, environment
management system, HR management,
human rights, ESG governance
mechanism and disclosures, and
quality management system, as
applicable. Furthermore, we assess
suppliers on various environment
related KPIs such as the availability
of environment-related training
programmes, energy consumption,
GHG emissions, air emissions, waste
and water management.

During the reporting period, 125 out

of 142 significant suppliers (88%)
underwent detailed assessments which
included criteria such as environment,
health and safety, and working
conditions. No negative impacts

were identified, but the Observations
for Improvements (OFI) were noted
and corrective action plans were
developed for 12 high-risk suppliers, all
of whom were assisted by our internal

team in implementing the corrective
action plans. The action plans tackle
non-compliance by identifying root
causes and setting measurable, time-
bound interventions.

Defined timelines guide the
improvement process and suppliers
unable to meet minimum ESG
standards within the stipulated
timeframe face disqualification.
However, as all suppliers met

the necessary requirements, no
terminations occurred during the
reporting period.

For FY 2024-25, a total of 895 suppliers
were assessed on legal/litigation,
financial, credit check, regulatory,
adverse information, sanction,
environmental and social criteria, with
no negative impacts. 100% of these
suppliers were evaluated for human
rights issues, including discrimination,
sexual harassment, child labour, forced
labour, and wages; no violations were
reported. Further insights into the
human rights assessment are shared in
the Human Capital section.

Copper Business: Due Diligence
Framework under The Copper
Mark

We are proud to be the first Indian
copper manufacturer to achieve the
Joint Due Diligence Standard (JDDS)
under The Copper Mark framework.
This reinforces our commitment to
ethical and sustainable production.
Developed in collaboration with The
Copper Mark, the International Lead
Association (ILA), the Nickel Institute
(ND), the International Zinc Association
(IZA), and the Responsible Minerals
Initiative (RMI), the JDDS sets a
stringent benchmark for ethical and
conflict-free mineral sourcing. This
globally recognised standard aligns with
the OECD Due Diligence Guidance,
providing a strong foundation for
responsible mineral procurement and
sustainable resource management.

By aligning with the JDDS, we have
reinforced our commitment to ethical

sourcing, human rights, supply

chain transparency, and rigorous,
independently verified site-level
practices. Recognised by the London
Metal Exchange (LME) under its ‘Track
A’ responsible sourcing requirements,
this achievement highlights the
robustness of our practices. As India's
leading copper producer, we continue to
set new benchmarks for transparency,
sustainability, and responsible sourcing
across the industry.

Supplier Risk Assessment

One of the key assessments

we conduct is the supplier risk
assessment, which can be carried
out either online or through physical
evaluations. This process involves
thorough assessments conducted
before onboarding new suppliers
and the subsequent assessments
based on the supplier categorisation
and business relationship criticality
at a defined frequency. Based on
these evaluations, Tier 1 suppliers or
significant suppliers are categorised
as high, medium, or low risk, impacting
their business opportunities and
relationship with us.

The evaluations consider various
criteria, including health and safety
practices, environmental sustainability,
labour management, human rights,
regulatory compliance, financial
stability, and market dependency.
We also conduct scenario analyses
to identify potential risks across

the supply chain and accordingly
update our evaluation parameters.
For significant suppliers, ESG criteria
are given considerable weight in the
rating process.

We follow a distinct risk rating
methodology for physical assessments,
with a maximum score of 100. Any
supplier scoring below 70 is considered
high risk. This comprehensive
approach ensures a resilient and
responsible supply chain, aligned with
our commitment to ethical business
practices and sustainability.

Supplier Development

Supplier development is integral to
advancing our sustainability agenda
and cultivating long-term partnerships
through strategic investments in

supplier growth. We conduct structured

engagement activities throughout the
year via communication initiatives,
vendor assessments, audits, training

workshops, seminars, and stakeholder
surveys. Comprehensive workshops
systematically refine supplier practices,
strengthening their commitment to

responsible business operations. In

FY 2024-25, capacity-building initiatives
were extended to 12 (8%) significant
suppliers, helping them understand our
ESG requirements and interventions to
elevate their ESG performance.

Biennial global vendor meets serve
as a key platform to build enduring
business relationships and promote
ESG integration. These forums

allow senior leaders direct access to
suppliers to reinforce sustainability
imperatives. Additionally, there are
plant-level vendor meets with local
suppliers to ensure alignment on
ESG expectations, programmes, and
compliance requirements. These
meets help clearly communicate our
ESG-specific expectations, supplier
ESG programmes, processes, and
requirements, ensuring alignment and
mutual understanding.

During the reporting period, a large-scale
vendor meet convened representatives
from nearly 100 significant suppliers and
over 150 business partners worldwide.
Supply chain sustainability priorities
were outlined, with an emphasis on

the pivotal role of ESG compliance

in advancing operational resilience,
enhancing supply chain integrity, and

fostering collaborative business success.

Supplier Grievance
Mechanism

Our grievance mechanism empowers
suppliers to proactively raise their
concerns and issues. Ahead of our
global and plant-level vendor meetings,
we solicit input and feedback from

key vendors regarding any challenges
or grievances they encounter. These
issues are then addressed by senior
management during the meetings. Any
unresolved grievances are escalated
by the vendors to the relevant teams for
swift resolution. Additionally, suppliers
may also raise concerns through our
open ethics line. Our Supplier Code of
Conduct contains information on the
open ethics email ID meant for suppliers
to raise any concerns. No complaints
were received in the reporting period.

Supply Chain Risk
Management

At Hindalco, an enterprise risk
register meticulously tracks critical
vulnerabilities, classifying them by
severity into green, yellow, amber, or
red categories. Root cause analysis
ensures alignment between identified
risks and organisational objectives,
aiding the formulation of mitigation
frameworks. Monthly evaluations help
verify the effective implementation of
these plans, contributing to a reduction
in the risk scores.

In response to geopolitical volatility,
decisive measures have been taken to
strengthen supply chain sustainability.
The Responsible Sourcing Policy

and the Conflict Affected and High-
Risk Areas (CAHRA) determination
methodology help mitigate threats
from high-risk sourcing countries.
Close coordination between the
Supply Chain and ERM teams enables
real-time detection of geopolitical
fluctuations and swift execution

of countermeasures.

Digitalisation in the Supply
Chain

We, at Hindalco, have introduced
significant digital advancements to
streamline processes and enhance
coordination. As part of our digital
transformation journey, we have
successfully transitioned from
operating multiple ERP instances toa
unified, single-instance ERP system.
This harmonisation has significantly
streamlined procurement operations
by enabling standardised processes
across business units, enhancing
overall efficiency. Centralising data
has eliminated redundancy and
ensured real-time access to accurate
information, improving decision-
making and collaboration across
procurement teams.

The unified ERP platform has brought
notable advancements in transparency
and governance. With consistent data
structures and centralised reporting,

procurement professionals now have
end-to-end visibility into spend, supplier
performance, and compliance metrics.
This transparency strengthens internal
controls and ensures better adherence
to procurement policies. Furthermore,
standardised workflows and automation
have reduced manual effort, increased
process reliability, and boosted overall
productivity. The harmonised ERP
environment has not only improved
operational efficiency but also laid

a strong foundation for future digital
innovations in procurement.

At Hindalco, digitalisation has been at
the core of the process transformation,
productivity improvement and increase
in transparency and governance. Our
major units have transformed to 100%
paperless working and approvals. We
have also leveraged the centralised
procurement data repository to develop
arobust risk identification mechanism
on areal time basis that mitigates risk
and ensures transparency, statutory
compliance and governance in our
supply chain process. More than 20 key
risk indicators in vendor management,
payment processing and order
processing have been identified and
are evaluated on a real-time basis and
any deviation is highlighted. These
deviations make up the risk score of
the particular unit and leads to the
identification of mitigation measures to
reduce the risk score.

Additionally, access to critical
information has been enhanced
through multiple digitisation

initiatives, improving visibility and
coordination across the procurement
team. A centralised dashboard now
consolidates spend data, supplier
assessments, and key risk KPls,
eliminating dependencies and ensuring
seamless data access.

Effective internal communication is also
acornerstone of operational success
across our units in India. A structured
communication framework allows

swift dissemination of information
across teams.

Logistics

Our logistics operations are a critical enabler of sustainable value delivery across
our wide-reaching network. With facilities spanning across diverse geographical
locations, the logistics function encounters significant challenges in transporting
large volumes of commodities over long distances. However, by leveraging volume-
based strategies and meticulous planning and coordination we optimise efficiency
and secure commercial benefits. The logistics team serves as a link between various
unit logistics, from mines to marketing, collaborating nationwide to reinforce our
pursuit of operational excellence and cost leadership.

implemented in the reporting year
to manage business distribution
digitally, ensuring fairness and
transparency. The OTM system
oversees all logistics processes, from
freight discovery to negotiation and
spot booking, enhancing efficiency
and transparency.

Data from the Logistics Analytics
dashboard and Customer
Relationship Management (CRM)
software is utilised to onboard
logistics partners and renew their
contracts. This transition from
manual to digital operations has
improved operational efficiency and
aligns with the sustainability target by
minimising errors and saving time.

Assessing Logistics
Partners

Assessing logistics partners is
crucial to ensuring compliance with
our stringent standards and policies.
During the reporting period, 100% of
logistics partners were assessed for
environmental and social impacts,
including sexual harassment,
discrimination, child labour, forced
labour, wages, health and safety, and
workplace conditions. Additionally,
our in-house corporate logistics
team evaluated the operational
performance of 90% of vendors
handling finished goods. Units and
mining locations also regularly review
vendor performance through their
own systems.

Operational risks, including safety,
theft, transit damage, delays,

and environmental impact, are
systematically assessed and managed
through a Risk Register, with mitigation
plans regularly updated to ensure
ongoing improvements. Health

and safety compliance is enforced
through contractual agreements,
rigorous audits, periodic inspections,
and structured safety protocols,
including certified equipment checks,
training initiatives, and adherence to
global standards.

At Novelis, we monitor vendor
performance with a balanced
scorecard that evaluates operational
efficiency, safety, sustainability,

and pricing. Quarterly Business
Reviews with key vendors yield both
qualitative and quantitative feedback;
improvements and corrective actions
are tracked diligently.

Efforts Towards

Sustainable Transportation

Our commitment to sustainable
transportation is reflected in several
key initiatives aimed at reducing our
environmental footprint. We aim to
achieve a 60% conversion to Green
Modes (including EVs, LNG, CNG,

& Bharat Stage VI norms) for our

fleet by FY 2025-26. Along with EV
contracts yielding significant emission
reductions, they also provide long-term
cost benefits and price stability as the
contractual rates remain unaffected by
diesel price fluctuations.

At Renukoot, we have deployed an EV
for the in-plant movement of red mud.

Initially focused on short-haul routes, we

are gradually integrating the use of EVs
for long-haul movements. Further, we
are transitioning from the use of diesel
material handling equipment (MHEs)
to EV MHEs. At Aditya Aluminium, we
have recently deployed 20 EVs for the
transportation of fly ash to a nearby
cement plant. Commercial negotiations
are in progress to introduce EVs from
Hirakud FRP to Aditya FRP and from
Dahej to Asoj and Halol.

Introducing EV in Short
Haul Routes

Reducing carbon emissions

and enhancing efficiency in
short-haul routes became a
priority, necessitating a shift

to cleaner and cost-effective
transportation solutions. Traditional
logistics operations had a high
environmental impact, prompting
the need for strategic interventions
to integrate sustainable practices
into our supply chain.

To achieve this, we collaborated with
multiple OEMs to identify suitable
electric vehicles (EVs) and partnered
with logistics service providers
(LSPs) to implement long-term
contracts. The initiative focused

on deploying EVs without direct
vehicle procurement, leveraging
existing and new LSPs to ensure
seamless adoption. Expansion
plans were set in motion to introduce
EVs across all mining operations,
including Chakla and Samri mines.
Additionally, several trial routes from
Raipur warehouse were evaluated
for LNG deployment.

We successfully deployed four LNG
vehicles on key routes, reducing 16
tCO,e of emissions. Furthermore,
the introduction of 20 EVs between
Aditya Aluminium and UltraTech
Lapanga resulted in a reduction

of 3,500 tCO,,e while saving ¥1.5
crore in freight costs. Long-term
contracts at consistent freight rates
enhanced both environmental

and commercial sustainability,
solidifying our commitment to

greener logistics solutions.

Furthermore, we ensure that Hazard
Identification and Risk Assessment

is conducted, and a mitigation plan

is defined. To mitigate the negative
impacts caused by the transportation
of coal, hazardous waste, and fly

ash, we mandate the use of proper
tarpaulin coverings with seals for all
coal trucks. Similarly, fly ash trucks and
rail wagons are covered with tarpaulin,
and hazardous waste is transported in
vehicles certified by the State Pollution
Board. Alumina is transported using
our BTAP rakes or bulkers to minimise
losses and protect the environment.

+

Shifting PME Activities
for BTAP Rakes to Sarla

Efficient logistics is important in
ensuring seamless supply chain
operations. At our Vishakhapatnam
Division, we identified prolonged
Periodical Maintenance
Examination (PME) time asa

key bottleneck. The extended
turnaround time was limiting the
number of trips per rake, prompting
us to prioritise optimisation to
enhance operational efficiency.

To address this, we proactively
advocated with East Coast Railways
and requested authorities to relocate
the PME activities to Sarla, the
nearest PME yard. We submitted
formal representations and held
discussions with key authorities

to reinforce the necessity of this
shift. Through persistent efforts,
approval was secured, allowing the
transition of PME operations from
Vishakhapatnam to Sarla.

This initiative streamlined transit
schedules, reducing PME time by
1.5 - 2 days. The increased number
of trips per rake improved logistics
efficiency, strengthened our supply
chain, and reinforced collaboration
with Indian Railways. Through this
strategic intervention, we were
able to support uninterrupted and
sustainable operations.

Digitalising Customer
Management

Over the past year, we have focused
on improving customer experience

through digitalisation. We have
invested in smart sensors, supply chain

automation, and advanced dashboards.

These innovations have enhanced
productivity, improved output quality,
and accelerated response times. As
a result, complaints have decreased,
and customer confidence has grown.
Our digitalised order-taking system,
powered by Oracle and Ekaayan,
integrates sales and production for

Together, we have launched projects
aimed at decoding customer behaviour,
predicting future demand, and proactively
addressing potential concerns. A notable
initiative includes a model that analyses
complaints and identifies root causes at
the plant level, allowing for instant issue
flagging and swift resolutions before they
impact customers.

We have also implemented advanced
measures to enhance packaging
quality, benchmarking against industry-

leading standards. The introduction of
an automatic palletiser has significantly
streamlined our packaging operations,
increasing efficiency, consistency, and
overall product handling.

In the Specialty Alumina business, the
ongoing transformation of the Sales &
Operations Planning (SSOP) system
will further improve service. Current
modules already facilitate demand
forecasting and optimised production
planning, while future enhancements
will systematically commit dispatch
dates to customers based on real-

planning processes.

Data-Driven Coil Predictive Performance Allocation

Model - CAM

To optimise copper rod production for
various applications, we customised
the Continuous Casting and

Rolling (CCR) process to enhance
downstream performance and provide
tailored solutions. We implemented the
Coil Allocation Module (CAM), which
synchronises customer data with rod
process data to ensure alignment with
application requirements.

By integrating data from rod
manufacturing and customer
downstream plants into a centralised
server, CAM uses a predictive Al

model trained on two years of historical
data to forecast coil performance.

This enables effective allocation while
minimising rejections and rework.
Continuous analysis of performance
trends and real-time quality feedback
further refines the model for greater
accuracy and optimisation.

This initiative has resulted ina
significant reduction in wire breaks,
improved customer satisfaction, and
fewer complaints, enhancing efficiency
and reliability in the production process.

Customer Grievance
Redressal Mechanism

Customers can lodge complaints 24/7
through various channels, including
phone calls, emails, logbooks,
meetings, interactions, and surveys.
All responses are categorised into
positives and detractors, ensuring the
timely resolution of issues.

We actively address customer
complaints through an internal report
and the Corrective and Preventive
Actions (CAPA) protocol. Regular
meetings and customer visits help
identify and resolve issues, with

escalations managed by plant or
technical teams when necessary.

Once resolved, we share a complaint
settlement report detailing corrective
actions with the customer. Quarterly
audits ensure continuous improvement
and faster resolution times.

In FY 2024-25, we received 39 customer
complaints from the Copper business,

strategy. Through NPS surveys, we
conduct a detailed cross-functional
analysis of customer feedback and
comprehend their perceptions in
depth. This comprehensive and
structured feedback loop ensures
that we continually evolve to exceed
customer expectations and reinforce

effective collaboration with
policymakers both directly as well

international, national, and state-level
industry bodies and associations.

Climate-related Direct Policy Advocacy Positions

Globally, we have been a member

of the World Business Council for
Sustainable Development (WBCSD) for
over a decade. Our senior leaders also
hold memberships in the International
Aluminium Institute (IAI), allowing us to
collaborate with the Mission Possible
Partnership (MPP) to accelerate the

resources needed to achieve ‘Net

Zero’ by 2050. Further, our Group CSO
co-chairs the Energy and Environment
Committee of the IAI and also serves

onthe South Asia Advisory Board of the
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).

As global governments develop
carbon import taxes, Novelis
collaborates with industry
associations to ensure border
measures to prevent carbon leakage
without resorting to protectionism.
In the UK, Brazil, and Europe, we
advocate within the Carbon Border
Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), task
force of European Aluminium and

pursued through our participation

in various trade associations such

as the Confederation of Indian
Industry (Cll), the Federation of Indian
Chambers of Commerce and Industry
(FICCI), and the Bombay Chamber

of Commerce and Industry (BCCI),
among others. We are a member of
these associations and represent

both the Company and the broader
industry in climate related initiatives.
These trade associations have climate
change policy advocacy as a key focus
area. Accordingly, the positions and
recommendations we advocate directly
are also communicated through these
national forums in engagement with the
Government of India.

Engaging with national stakeholders
through forums such as FICCI, Cll,
BCCI, FIMI, and FEIO, we catalyse

Key Initiatives and Expansion Plans
during FY 2024-25

FY 2024-25 marked a Strategically important year for
Hindalco, with significant progress across the Aluminium,
Copper, and Specialty Alumina businesses. The Company
deepened its focus on strengthening upstream capabilities
while accelerating value-added downstream growth.

In line with its strategic imperatives, Hindalco is focused

on doubling down its Upstream aluminium and copper
capacities, while aiming to achieve four times growth

in downstream EBITDA in India by FY 2029-30 from

FY 2023-24 levels. This will be driven by capacity expansion,
resource securitisation and premiumisation of downstream
value-added products. These efforts are set to boost
Hindalco’s long-term competitiveness, diversify its product
mix, and tap into growing demand across energy, mobility,
packaging, and industrial sectors. This strategic shift is also
reflected in Hindalco’s new brand identity, which signals its
evolution from a raw materials supplier to a provider of high-
performance, engineered solutions.

In the aluminium upstream segment, capacity expansion

achieved operational efficiencies and lowered the overall cost
of production in FY 2024-25.

In the downstream aluminium portfolio, Hindalco continued
to expand its footprint in high-growth, high-margin segments.
Key developments included progress on the new 170 KT
FRP facility at Aditya as well as capacity augmentation in
battery enclosures, extrusions, aerospace-grade alloys, and
packaging foils. The Company successfully delivered 10,000
EV Battery Enclosures and is scaling its extrusions portfolio
through brownfield expansions at Silvassa.

The Specialty Alumina business continued its upward
trajectory, maintaining its position among the global top three
producers. The Company remained on track to scale the
business to 1 million tonnes per annum over next three to five
years, driven by demand across premium applications such as
flame retardants, ceramics, catalysts, white fused alumina, and
precipitated hydrate. As part of our strategy to grow in high-
value, technology-led materials, Hindalco signed a definitive
agreement to acquire 100% equity in AluChem Companies
Inc., a US-based producer of specialty alumina, for an
enterprise value of US$125 million. This marks Hindalco’s entry

In copper, smelter expansion of 300 KT, copper and multi-
metal e-waste recycling, and 25 KT inner grooved tubes
projects are progressing swiftly to meet India’s demand of
copper in the growing air conditioning segment.

Novelis’ 3x30 vision to advance aluminium as the material of
choice for circular solutions through ambitious, carbon-related
sustainability goals and priorities to accelerate the company’s
decarbonisation and circularity efforts. This strategy is
focused on raising recycled content, reducing carbon intensity,
and improving Return on Invested Capital.

To support the rising demand for sustainable aluminium in
North America, Novelis' $4.1 billion, 600 KT greenfield rolling
and recycling facility at Bay Minette, Alabama is slated for
commissioning in the second half of CY 2026. Novelis is
setting new benchmarks in aluminium recycling, achieving
arecycled content rate of 63% in FY 2024-25, more than
double the level from 15 years ago. Leveraging its scale

and operational efficiency, the Company aims to reach 75%
recycled content by 2030.

Strategic investments are driving this progress, including the
commissioning of two major recycling centers in FY 2024-25:

Hindalco continues to foster a culture built on meritocracy,
inclusion, and employee development. Guided by clear
principles of fairness, transparency, and equal opportunity
across the organisation, we ensure that career growth is
driven by merit through structured talent programs and
data-based performance evaluations. Our commitment

to diversity is reflected in the fact that 35% of our young
professional hires over the past six years have been
women. Employee engagement has seen a consistent rise,
with a 13-point increase in the Trust Index from 2021 to
2024, and 82% of our people endorsing Hindalco as a great
place to work. We are proud to be ranked among the Top
50 Best Workplaces™ in Manufacturing 2025. To attract
and retain top talent, we continue to invest in leadership
development, capability building, and a collaborative,
inclusive work environment.

Outlook:

According to IMF projections, global GDP growth in

CY 2024 is expected to be around 2.8%. In the US, growth
is expected to slow to 1.8% in CY 2025 amid rising policy
uncertainty, trade tensions, and weaker demand. China's
growth is expected to moderate from 5.0% in CY 2024 to
4.0% in CY 2025, weighed down by a weak property sector
and trade tensions. India, however, remains a bright spot,
with a forecast of 6.2% for CY 2025. Overall, advanced
economies are likely to grow by 1.4%, while emerging
economies are likely to grow by 3.7%.

Global primary aluminium demand is expected to
moderate to ~73.5 million tonnes in CY 2025, reflecting

a growth of just 1% Y-o0-Y. Global production is also
expected to be ~73.5 million tonnes leading to a balanced
market. Production in the World excluding China, is
expected to increase ~2% reaching just over 30 million
tonnes. Primary aluminium supply in China is expected to
grow by ~1% to alittle over 43 million tonnes in CY 2024.
Consequently, inventories are likely to remain stable at
around 9.8 million tonnes by the end of CY 2025.

The Indian market is likely to see a steady growth across
all sectors. Imports of aluminium products, including
scrap, continue to remain a major concern for domestic
aluminium producers. Over the past few years, the
domestic rolled and foil products industries have seen an
increase in imports, especially from China and the FTA
countries, at lower prices. The government has supported
the aluminium industry by imposing Anti-Dumping Duty
(‘ADD’) on imports of flat-rolled products from China.
The foil industry has petitioned with the Government on
imposing ADD on foil imports from China to support the
industry against unfair trade practices.

Copper - Industry Review S Outlook

In CY 2024, global copper production rose by

~4.1% to 26.9 million tonnes, while consumption grew
by ~3% to 26.5 million tonnes, resulting in a surplus

of ~300 KT. However, the market is expected to shift
towards a deficit in CY 2025 due to stagnant mine supply
growth and new capacity additions concentrated in
China, Indonesia, and the Congo. Volatile LME prices
have dampened the appetite for launching new mining
projects, leading to raw material shortages and allowing
miners to dominate the market, which has adversely
impacted TC/RC. Record-low TC/RGs in late CY 2024
and early CY 2025 have already led to production cuts

at major smelters, with deeper reductions likely ahead.
Additionally, the announcement of U.S. tariffs in April
2025 and subsequent retaliatory measures by China
and other countries have added to market uncertainty,
intensifying LME price volatility. Despite these near-term
disruptions, the long-term outlook for copper demand
remains positive.

In CY 24, China's refined copper production rose by
~5.6% to 12.2 million tonnes, while consumption
increased by ~4.7% to 15.3 million tonnes, leading to a
market deficit of 3.2 million tonnes. Outside China, global
production grew by ~3%, outpacing consumption growth
of ~2.2% and resulting in a surplus of 3.5 million tonnes.
Approximately 350 KT of production cuts were reported
in China due to falling TC/RC and tight mine supply,

with deeper cuts anticipated through the remainder of

Novelis - Global Flat Rolled Products
(‘FRP’) - Industry Review & Outlook

For over a decade, Novelis has pursued a multi-year
strategy aimed at transforming its business and
enhancing profitability through significant investments in
new capacity and capabilities. These investments have
enabled the Company to increase recycled content in

its products, capitalise on favourable long-term market
trends that are driving greater consumer demand for
lightweight, sustainable aluminium products, and
diversify and optimise its product portfolio. As a global
leader in aluminium flat-rolled products, Novelis has
leveraged this expanded capacity, broad footprint, scale,
and strong customer relationships to drive volumes and
benefit from favourable supply and demand dynamics
across all end-use markets. Supported by growth in
volumes, improved pricing, a substantial increase in

regional policy-related challenges, the medium- to long-
term outlook for global FRP demand across end-use
sectors remains positive, driven by strong sustainability
trends and secular growth drivers.

Novelis is facing rising competition for scrap metal, driven
by strong demand for aluminium rolled products with high
recycled content, increasing focus on carbon reduction,
and the cost advantages of using scrap over primary
metal. Intensifying competition for scrap aluminium is
driving up prices and reducing the financial advantage of
using scrap in our production processes.

To address supply-demand imbalances of scrap, Novelis
is exploring a broader mix of scrap metal sources,
supported by improved sorting technologies and supply
chain enhancements. Novelis has started implementing
structural cost reduction measures across its global
operations to drive sustainable labour, operational and
footprint efficiencies. This is a multi-year cost efficiency
goal, with a target to achieve approximately $300 million
in annualised savings by the end of FY 2027-28.

Domestic market

In FY 2024-25, domestic demand for refined copper rose
by ~5% to 850 KT, up from 811 KT in FY 2023-24. Imports
accounted for ~26% of the total demand at 223 KT,
compared to 30% i.e, 240 KT in FY 2023-24, indicating

a gradual reduction in import dependence. The overall
market remained stable, with growth expectations of
around 8-9% in FY 2025-26. Hindalco’s copper sales
grew by 6-7% in FY 2024-25 over FY 2023-24, while

the Company sustained strong customer satisfaction,
achieving Net Promoter Score (NPS) of over 70% for

FY 2024-25.

Copper Concentrate Market

The annual TC/RC benchmark for CY 2025 settled at
5.45 cents per pound, representing a 73% year-on-
year decline from 20.5 cents per pound in CY 2024.
Concentrate market continues to be extremely tight
resulting in lower spot TC/RC terms. The market is
expected to remain under pressure in the short to

medium term until market rebalances through potential
smelter closures mainly in China or through new mining
capacity additions.

Outlook:

The global refined copper demand is projected to grow
by ~2.8% in CY 2025, led by China at ~3.4%, while the
rest of the world is expected to see growth at ~1.8%. In
India, demand is likely to reach ~920 KT in FY 2025-26.
The copper market is expected to shift into a deficit in
CY 2025, primarily due to constrained mine supply and
the absence of major new project additions, though some
capacity expansion is anticipated in China, Indonesia,
and the Congo. Additionally, smelter production is being
impacted by declining TC/RC observed in late CY 2024
and early CY 2025, prompting miners to cut production.
While ongoing US-China trade tensions and LME price
volatility continue to be uncertain in short-term, the long-
term demand outlook for copper remains robust. The
Copper Concentrate market remains tight, leading to a
decline in spot TC/RC terms. The market is expected to

6% in CY 2024, supported by strong momentum across
key end markets. Beverage packaging continued to
experience robust growth worldwide, driven by increasing
consumption and a clear shift in packaging preferences
toward sustainable solutions such as aluminium.

In the automotive sector, lightweighting remained a
primary demand driver, particularly in North America,
where the favourable vehicle mix of SUVs and trucks
supported higher aluminium usage. Growth in China
moderated due to changes in vehicle mix, while tariff
uncertainties in Europe and North America contributed
to near-term market volatility. In the Specialty segment,
there was a seasonal increase in demand of Building

& Construction sector, with the U.S. housing market
remaining structurally under supplied and potential
favourable trade rulings expected to further benefit the
domestic light gauge market. Aerospace demand stayed
strong, underpinned by multi-year OEM order backlogs
and increasing focus on sustainability, although supply
chain constraints continued to limit production ramp-up.
Geopolitical tensions and trade policy uncertainties
remained important factors to monitor. Overall, despite

aluminium beverage packaging. To support the demand
for aluminium beverage packaging sheet in North
America, we are in the process of building a 600 KT
capacity greenfield rolling and recycling plant in Bay
Minette, Alabama. We plan to allocate more than half

of this plant’s capacity to the production of beverage
packaging sheet. We continue to evaluate opportunities
for additional capacity expansion across regions, where
local can sheet supply is insufficient to meet long-term
demand growth.

The long-term demand for aluminium automotive sheet
will continue to grow, primarily driven by the benefits

of lightweight aluminium in vehicle structures and
components. Automakers are increasingly adopting
aluminium to meet stricter government regulations

on emissions and fuel economy, while maintaining or
improving vehicle safety and performance. Demand is
further supported by the rise of electric vehicles, where
aluminium’s lighter weight helps extend battery range and
improve overall efficiency.

The long-term demand for building and construction and
other specialty products shall grow due to increased
customer preference for lightweight, sustainable
materials. Demand for aluminium plate in Asia is slated
to grow driven by the development and expansion of
industries serving aerospace, rail, and other technically
demanding applications.

Demand for aerospace aluminium plate and sheet also
remain favourable due to strong OEM build rates, but
their ability to produce has been constrained by OEM
supply chain instability. In the longer-term, significant
aircraft industry order backlogs for key OEMs, including
Airbus and Boeing, will translate into growth in the future
and that Novelis’ multi-year supply agreements have

positioned it well to benefit from future expected demand.

c. Novelis

Operational Overview:

In FY 2024-25, Novelis’ total shipments were up 2% over the
past year, at 3.757 million tonnes. The increase in shipments
is mainly due to record high beverage packaging shipments
and higher shipments for aerospace products, partially
offset by lower shipments of specialties and automotive
products. The share of beverage can sheet shipments were
60%, automotive body sheet shipments were at 19%, and
specialities and aerospace shipments were at 18% and 3%,
respectively. Novelis leveraged its extensive recycling footprint
and favourable market conditions to utilise 63% recycled
content in its shipments in the reporting period.

Novelis operates in four key geographies: North America, Europe,
Asia, and South America. In North America in FY 2024-25 total
third-party shipments were at 1.518 million tonnes up from 1.513
million tonnes in FY 2023-24, in line with the prior year, as higher
beverage packaging shipments were mostly offset by lower
specialty shipments, while automotive shipments were roughly
in line with prior year period. In Europe, Novelis shipped 0.985
million tonnes in FY 2024-25, an increase from 0.967 million
tonnes in FY 2023-24 up by 2%, as higher beverage packaging
shipments were mostly offset by lower automotive shipments.

In Asia, Novelis shipped 0.626 million tonnes of rolled products
in FY 2024-25 versus 0.623 million tonnes in the previous

year, due to largely higher beverage packaging shipments

and higher average LME aluminium prices, partially offset by
lower automotive and specialty shipments. In South America,
Novelis shipped 0.628 million tonnes in FY 2024-25, up from
0.570 million tonnes in FY 2023-24 up by 10%, primarily in the
beverage packaging market supported by higher average LME
aluminium prices. In FY 2024-25, Novelis reported an overall
EBITDA/tonne of US$480 a decrease from US$510/tonne in the
last year.

Financial Overview:

Novelis’ Net Sales in FY 2024-25 were at $17.15 billion, up
6% from $16.21 billion in FY 2023-24, primarily driven by
higher average aluminium prices and a 2% increase in total
shipments compared to the prior year.

Net income from continuing operations (excluding Special
Items) was at $764 million, an increase of 11% compared to
$688 million in FY 2023-24. Novelis reported Adjusted EBITDA
of $1.802 billion vs $1.873 billion, adecrease of 4%, on account
of higher aluminium scrap prices compared to the prior year,
unfavourable product mix, and higher operating cost, partially
offset by higher total shipments and higher product pricing.

The increase in net income is on account of favourable change
in metal price lag and unrealised gains on derivatives, as well
as lower income tax provision, partially offset by impacts from
the Sierre flooding and lower Adjusted EBITDA.

Hindalco Industries Limited
Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 272 — 273

Finance Cost

Finance cost declined by 11% to %3,419 crore in FY 2024-25
from 23,858 crore in FY 2023-24. This was primarily due

to higher capitalisation of interest on qualifying capital
expenditure projects, amounting to 780 crore in FY 2024-25
against ¥316 crore in FY 2023-24 This includes increased
capitalisation of borrowing costs related to eligible capital
expenditure, which were transferred to Capital Work in
Progress (CWIP).

Depreciation and amortisation (including net
impairment loss/ (reversal) of non-current assets)

Depreciation and amortisation (including net impairment loss/
(reversal) ofnon-current assets) increased to 8,864 crore in

FY 2024-25 from #7,881 crore in FY 2023-24 primarily due to
impairment charges recognised during the year. These included
3732 crore towards impairment of property, plant and equipment,
and #44 crore for Capital Work-in-Progress, following the
announced shutdown of Novelis’ Richmond and Fairmont facilities
in North America and one finishing line in Changzhou, Asia, as of
March 31, 2025. Additionally, further impairment charges related
to previously announced closures included $177 crore for the
Clayton facility in New Jersey, 7154 crore for the Buckhannon
facility in West Virginia, and #4 crore towards impairment in Capital
Work-in-Progress. Novelis also impaired 365 crore for suspended
construction projects and #123 crore towards right-of-use assets
due to the write-off of land use rights in Asia.

Exceptional Income/ (Expense)

In FY 2024-25, total exceptional expense stood at 879 crore,
compared to #21 crore in FY 2023-24. This increase was
primarily on account of the impact of severe flooding at Novelis
Sierre facility in Switzerland on 30 June 2024, which led to
temporary suspension of operations. While there were no
injuries and plant operations have since fully resumed, the
event resulted in damage to property, plant and equipment

of #250 crore and inventory write-downs of $101 crore.
Additionally, Novelis’ incurred shutdown-related costs of

3168 crore, repairs and clean-up costs of #318 crore, excess
fulfilment costs of 291 crore, and other associated expenses
amounting to #41 crore. These were partially offset by property
insurance recoveries of 290 crore recognised by Novelis
during the year. Hindalco India Operations also recogniseda
provision for expected cost of disposal of legacy ash lying inash
dykes/ponds, in accordance with the Ministry of Environment,
Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) guidelines, further
contributing to the overall exceptional expense.

Taxes

Provision for taxes was at 76,335 crore in FY 2024-25
against ¥3,857 crore in FY 2023-24. This increase was due to
significant higher profitability of the Company in FY 2024-25,
and Hindalco standalone retaining the existing tax structure
of old regime until utilising accumulated MAT Credit and
deductions under Chapter VIA of the Income Tax Act.

The Company re-measured the deferred tax liability for the
future transition to the new tax regime, writing back #239 crore
of the net deferred tax liability during the year.

Business Outlook

Hindalco’s transformation into an innovation-led, customer-centric
and sustainability-driven metals powerhouse continues to gain
momentum. Backed by a decade-long focus on operational
excellence, disciplined capital allocation, and responsible growth,
Hindalco is building a future-ready portfolio across aluminium and
copper — both in India and through Novelis.

At the core of Hindalco’s strategy lies a dual focus: driving high-
margin growth through downstream expansions and specialty
products and reinforcing its position as a global leader in
sustainable, low-carbon aluminium and copper solutions. Over
the next five years, Hindalco plans to invest over $10 billion,
equally split between its India operations and Novelis, to expand
capacities, diversify end-use markets, and enhance resilience.

Despite near-term global headwinds such as inflation, volatile
scrap markets, and elevated interest rates impacting certain
segments like construction, Hindalco has maintained robust
financial discipline.

Hindalco’s Aluminium business in India remains firmly
positioned in the first quartile of the global cost curve,
underpinned by access to captive alumina and coal, backward
integration, and a growing share of renewable energy. The
business is currently executing expansions across its smelters
and refining operations, including an 850 KTPA alumina
refinery and multiple downstream FRP and extrusion projects.

Hindalco has successfully delivered 10,000 aluminium
battery enclosures for electric vehicles from its new facility
in Chakan. This marks its strategic foray into the EV
components segment, enabling a 40% weight reduction and
8-10% improvement in range over steel alternatives. The
Company is also progressing on downstream projects like
the Aditya FRP and ramping up Silvassa extrusions facility,
further strengthening its position in high-value, low-carbon
aluminium products.

With over 500 KTPA in sales in FY 2024-25, Hindalco is among
the top three global specialty alumina players, catering to
niche segments like flame retardants, ceramics, catalysts,

and electronics. The Company aims to double this to 1 mtpa
within next three years, supported by the commissioning of a
new precipitated hydrate plant and an upcoming white fused
alumina facility in Belagavi.

Hindalco’s Copper business is in the midst of a significant
scale-up, driven by a brownfield smelter expansion at Dahej
(from 421 Ktpa to 700 Ktpa) and the commissioning of India’s
first copper and multi-metal recycling facility at Pakhajan,
Gujarat. The business is commissioning a 25 Ktpa Inner
Grooved Tube plant and advancing work on a copper foil plant
for EV batteries.

Hindalco’s strategic imperatives centre on strengthening

its upstream and downstream businesses, deepening

its commitment to sustainability, and delivering superior
stakeholder value. Hindalco’s strategic focus is to double
down on upstream capacities through significant investments
in aluminium and copper smelter expansion, and a greenfield
alumina refinery. On the downstream side, Hindalco is
targeting to quadruple its downstream EBITDA by FY 2029-30
over FY 2023-24 base by scaling its value-added portfolio in
aluminium, copper, specialty alumina, and recycling.

Novelis continues to lead globally in flat-rolled aluminium

and recycling. With $5 billion in planned Capex, including the
600 KTPA greenfield Bay Minette rolling and recycling facility,
the company is expanding its presence across the beverage
packaging, automotive, and specialty segments. While scrap
availability remains tight due to growing demand for low-
carbon aluminium, Novelis is implementing advanced sorting
systems and structural cost-out programs to mitigate rising
input costs. Novelis’ $300 million cost take-out programme by
FY 2027-28 is primarily to counter structural cost pressures,
particularly from rising scrap input prices, and to defend
margins. Despite near-term pressures in construction

and certain specialty markets, long-term demand drivers
remain strong. Beverage packaging demand is rebounding
post-inventory destocking and is projected to grow at 4%
CAGR (ex-China) through 2031, driven by sustainability
trends. Automotive aluminium demand is expected to rise at
7% CAGR from 2023 to 2028, as automakers increasingly
adopt aluminium for lightweighting and emissions compliance.
Aerospace aluminium demand also continues to strengthen,
supported by OEM order backlogs and multi-year contracts.

Indian companies ranked in the Top 1%. Hindalco is proud to
be one of them. We continue to strengthen our systems and
processes to build a future-ready and resilient organisation.

We work closely with stakeholders across our value chain
to address critical sustainability challenges, demonstrating
our commitment to inclusive growth and strengthening the
trust we've earned from partners, customers, investors,
and communities.

At Hindalco, a dedicated Board-level ESG and Risk Committee
reviews and guides our ESG strategy on a quarterly basis.

This is complemented by the Apex Sustainability Committee,
chaired monthly by the Managing Director, which provides

strategic direction, allocates resources, and closely monitors
progress to ensure the integration of sustainability priorities
across the business.

Our approach is supported by cross-functional task forces
and dedicated Sustainability SPOCs, enabling the translation
of strategy into impactful on-the-ground actions. We remain
firmly on track to achieving our Net Zero by 2050 ambition,
having already reached key milestones. Our renewable energy
capacity has grown to 189 MW, with a clear roadmap to scale
up to 300 MW by FY 2025-26.

At Hindalco, we are committed to becoming water positive by
2050, aligned with NITI Aayog’s Water Neutrality Toolkit. Our
approach is anchored in the 3M framework (Measure, Manage,
Mitigate) and the 7R principles (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle,
Recharge, Replenish, Report, and Respect water resources).

Our interim goals include increasing the share of rainwater

in our total water mix and enhancing groundwater recharge
through dedicated recharge wells. In FY 2024-25, five of our
upstream plants were certified under NITI Aayog’s “Aspiring”

278 — 279

During the year, we recorded a Lost Time Injury Frequency
Rate (LTIFR) of 0.26 and a Lost Time Injury Severity Rate
(LTISR) of 93.31. While the decline in high-severity incidents
and the absence of fatalities anong company employees

is encouraging, we deeply regret the loss of two contract
personnel. We extend our sincerest condolences to their
families and to those affected. Hindalco remains steadfast in
its commitment to implementing every possible measure to
prevent harm and ensure the safety of all individuals across
our operations and communities.

To further strengthen contractor safety management, Hindalco
has enhanced its pre-bid process to ensure that all business
partners have a clear understanding of the company’s safety
standards and expectations. This proactive approach aims to
engage partners who uphold high levels of safety practices.
The Company is also developing a specialised pool of
contractors to ensure that only qualified professionals are
deployed for high-risk operations.

As part of its commitment to fostering a safety-first culture,
Hindalco launched the ‘Suraksha ki Baat’ initiative during the
year. This platform actively involves senior leadership and
contractors in promoting safety awareness and encouraging
open dialogue around safety concerns.

Our behaviour-based safety (BBS) programmes have reached

a significant milestone, with over 473,000 BBS observations
recorded in FY 2024-25, This initiative continues to reinforce safe
behaviours and reduce unsafe practices across plants and mines.

In FY 2024-25, Hindalco invested over 1.7 lakh man-hours in
safety training for both direct employees and contract workers,
well above the targeted 1,238,040 man-hours. Each unit’s
safety taskforce and committee, developed in collaboration
with internal and external agencies, included at least two or
more trained subject matter experts (SMEs). These experts
play a key role in conducting safety trainings and supporting
Level 1 and Level 2 audits within their units, as well as Level 3
audits across other sites.

Hindalco's Apex Integrated Health Committee — chaired by

a senior business leader — plays a pivotal role in driving all

four components of Integrated Health: Preventive, Promotive,
Curative, and Rehabilitative care. The committee also oversees
occupational health risk management across operations,
ensuring a holistic and proactive approach to employee
well-being. Through regular reviews, best practice sharing,

and monitoring of key performance indicators, the committee
ensures continuous improvement in health risk assessments,
medical surveillance, workplace exposure controls, emergency
preparedness, and overall workforce well-being.

IN FY 2024-25, Hindalco conducted Qualitative Exposure
Assessments (QLEA) at six sites and Quantitative Exposure
Assessments (QNEA) at eight sites — spanning both

manufacturing and mining operations. Implementation is being
systematically tracked to ensure progressive mitigation of
health risks across all locations.

To enhance the accessibility and reliability of worker health
data and enable more effective analysis, the Company has
implemented PEHEL, a digital health management system,
across all sites. This platform streamlines periodic medical
examinations, maintains comprehensive health records,

and facilitates targeted health zone monitoring. Most units
have completed both qualitative and quantitative heat stress
assessments, with several also conducting physiological
workplace evaluations. These initiatives form part of a phased
strategy to proactively address heat-related risks and enhance
overall employee well-being.

In parallel, Hindalco has embraced a suite of digital safety
initiatives to drive operational safety and efficiency. The
Company has implemented a 100% E Permit-to-Work system
using tablets and fully deployed the PEHEL software on-site
for real-time monitoring of employee health zones. A robust
audit and assurance software system now supports safety
audits at all levels, while remote crawler technology has been
adopted to monitor tank thinkness. Al-enabled cameras have
been installed for hotspot detection in electrical switchyards,
and driver fatigue management systems are now operational
in all technological vehicles. Additionally, confined space gas
monitoring has been enabled through Rapid Deployment
Units. To integrate and analyse safety performance across
operations, a centralised Monthly Safety Report Dashboard
has been launched, offering a consolidated view of safety
data from all units and mines to support informed, data-driven
decision-making.

4,304 sessions were conducted in FY 2024-25. Hindalco’s
empowerment-by-design approach led to the podevolution of
617 decisions last year, and in the current year, the Company
has already devolved 584 decisions. These milestones are
strong indicators of Hindalco’s ongoing commitment to cultural
transformation and operational excellence.

Hindalco has reimagined itself for the future by embracing
cutting-edge innovations such as gamification and the
metaverse, staying ahead in an ever-evolving business
landscape. In a bold move to transform the new hire
experience, the Company launched a pioneering 3D gamified
onboarding platform - MetaLearn - built around the 4C
framework — Compliance, Clarity, Culture, and Connection.
This immersive platform enables new joiners to create
personalised 3D avatars and explore a virtual replica of
Hindalco’s OUC office, offering an engaging and interactive
introduction to the organisation. Enriched with dynamic
modules and high-quality multimedia content, including

3D visualisations and videos, the platform showcases
Hindalco’s diverse operations across units, mines, products,
brands, and core functions such as finance, people,

and processes.

To further enhance learning and engagement, Hindalco
introduced WeLearn, a WhatsApp-based microlearning
initiative that delivers daily bite-sized knowledge nuggets.
This ensures employees remain continuously informed
and connected to the business, its products, and
evolving practices.

Hindalco’s commitment to diversity is equally forward-looking.
The Company has made strong progress in gender diversity,
which rose to 11.41% in FY 2024-25 from 9.79% in

FY 2023-24. Anchored in a culture of zero discrimination,
Hindalco champions equal opportunity for all, ensuring
leadership roles are filled based on merit and potential,
regardless of gender.

To foster an inclusive and collaborative workplace, Hindalco
has established three Employee Resource Groups (ERGs),
each focused on empowering diverse segments of the
workforce. The W-ERG (Women Employee Resource Group)
is dedicated to promoting the growth, development, and
success of women at Hindalco by leveraging their unique

strengths to drive organisational goals. The Generational
ERG brings together Gen X (core leaders), Gen Y, and Gen Z
(emerging leaders) to foster intergenerational collaboration,
encouraging the exchange of ideas and diverse perspectives
across age groups.

Hindalco is actively embracing emerging technologies through
its Technical Career Path (TCP) programme, which currently
includes 75 high-potential engineers known as ‘TCPians.’
These professionals are contributing across diverse areas
such as New Product Development, Patenting, and Intellectual
Property Rights (IPR). Their efforts have led to 7 patents being
granted and 6 more filed.

To celebrate and reinforce this culture of innovation and
technical excellence, Hindalco organised ‘TCP Day’ on March
17-18, 2025. The event brought together over 100 participants
and served as a platform to honour the achievements of
TGPians and strengthen collaboration across teams.

The HTU Metaverse, launched in FY 2024-25, is elevating
learning at Hindalco, marking a significant leap toward digital
learning and innovation. This immersive, all-in-one platiorm
is designed to centralise and enhance knowledge retention
across our aluminium and copper value chains.

enable employees to share in the value they help create

Risk Management
{8.134(3)(n) of the Act & R. 21 of SEB! Listing Regulations}

Pursuant to the requirement of SEBI Listing
Regulations, the Company has constituted Risk
Management and Environment, Social and Governance
Committee /*RM & ESG’], which is mandated to review
the risk management plan/process of your Company.
The Company has a Risk Management Policy in place
and regularly reviewed by RM & ESG Committee. The
policy is applicable across all our operations and is
uploaded on the website of the Company at
www.hindalco.com.

We have an established risk governance framework that
enables proactive decision making and ensures the
organisation remains resilient. The Committee meets
every quarter and provides guidance and strategic
direction for effective risk management, with oversight
on risk exposure. The Committee also ensures that

appropriate methodology, processes, and systems are
in place to evaluate and monitor risks associated with
the business of the Company and reviews the adequacy
of the risk management practices and actions deployed
by the management for identification, assessment,
mitigation, monitoring and reporting of key risks to the
achievement of business objectives. We also have

Risk Steering Committee and Plant Risk Committee
comprising of various members such as direct reports of
Managing Director, plant heads, functional heads, etc.
These Committees ensure identification, mitigation, and
review of risks at various levels. Risk Owners, Mitigation
Owners, Risk Champion and Risk Coordinators are
mapped for management of various risks at different
levels.

Hindalco Enterprise Risk Management [“ERM”}
framework incorporates guidelines from international
frameworks including The Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission [“COso"}
and International Organization for Standardization
[tSO"} 31000 and benchmark industry practices while
also be tailored to suit the business objectives of the
Company. The framework is fully integrated with our
strategic priorities. Responsibility of ERM process
implementation is with Central ERM team while
accountability of managing risks is with the business.

The Chief Risk Officer /*cRO’] is responsible for the
functioning of enterprise risk management and heads
the central risk management team. The latter is the
custodian of the risk management process at all
locations. To manage the risks at the grassroots we
have an established team structure at cluster, plant,
and department levels. These teams are responsible
for implementing risk mitigation plans and report to
the Risk Management Head at regular intervals. The
ERM process being data intensive, an advanced IT
system has been deployed across the organisation for
management of risks through real time dashboards.
The digital system supports risk analytics and helps
in developing a uniform risk culture as the same ERM
framework is used from identification to reporting and
reviewing risks.

Risk management and compliance with risk procedures
are a part of the Key Result Areas /“KRAs‘] of senior
management and is linked to their variable incentives.
The year has been disruptive for the global business
environment, with the various geopolitical events,
policy changes, climate change, supply chain

Hindalco Industries Limited 916 — 317

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

We use secondary market data only as a reference point for determining the types and amount of remuneration while
principally believing that target total remuneration packages should reflect the typical cost of comparable executive talent
available in the sector.

Vv. Executive Pay-Mix

Our executive pay-mix aims to strike the appropriate balance between key components: (i) Fixed Cash compensation
(Basic Salary + Allowances) (ii) Annual Incentive Plan (iii) Long- Term Incentives (iv) Perks and Benefits.

Annual Incentive Plan

We tie annual incentive plan pay-outs of our executives to relevant financial and operational metrics achievement and
their individual performance. We annually align the financial and operational metrics with priorities/ focus areas for the
business.

Long-Term Incentive

Our Long-term incentive plans incentivize stretch performance, link executive remuneration to sustained long term growth
and act as a retention and reward tool.

We use stock options as the primary long-term incentive vehicles for our executives as we believe that they best align
executive incentives with stockholder interests.

We grant restricted stock units as a secondary long term incentive vehicle, to motivate and retain our executives.

Vi. Performance Goal Setting

We aim to ensure that for both annual incentive plans and long-term incentive plans, the target performance goals shall be
achievable and realistic.

Threshold performance (the point at which incentive plans are paid out at their minimum, but non-zero, level) shall reflect
a base-line level of performance, reflecting an estimated 890% probability of achievement.

Target performance is the expected level of performance at the beginning of the performance cycle, taking into account all
known relevant facts likely to impact measured performance.

Maximum performance (the point at which the maximum plan payout is made) shall be based on an exceptional level of
achievement, reflecting not more than an estimated 10% probability of achievement.

Vil. Executive Benefits and Perquisites

Our executives are eligible to participate in our broad-based retirement, health and welfare, and other employee benefit
plans. In addition to these broad-based plans, they are eligible for perquisites and benefits plans commensurate with their
roles. These benefits are designed to encourage long-term careers with the Group.

Other Remuneration Elements

Each of our executives is subject to an employment agreement. Each such agreement generally provides for a total
remuneration package for our executives including continuity of service across the Group Companies.

We limit other remuneration elements, for e.g. Change in Control [CIC] agreements, severance agreements, to instances of
compelling business need or competitive rationale and generally do not provide for any tax gross ups for our executives.

Risk and Compliance

We aim to ensure that the Group’s remuneration programs do not encourage excessive risk taking. We review our remuneration
programs for factors such as, remuneration mix overly weighted towards annual incentives, uncapped

pay-outs, unreasonable goals or thresholds, steep pay-out cliffs at certain performance levels that may encourage short-term
decisions to meet pay-out thresholds.

Claw back Clause

In an incident of restatement of financial statements, due to fraud or non-compliance with any requirement of the Companies
Act, 2013 and the rules made thereunder, we shall recover from our executives, the remuneration received in excess, of what
would be payable to him / her as per restated financial statements, pertaining to the relevant performance year.

Implementation

The Group and Business Centre of Expertise teams will assist the Nomination & Remuneration Committee of the Company
in adopting, interpreting and implementing the Executive Remuneration Philosophy/Policy. These services will be established
through “arm’s length”, agreements entered into as needs arise in the normal course of business.

along with Board's collective skill set forms part of their Profiles programs, customized to meet their specific requirements.

provided separately hereinabove. These Programmes were aimed to familiarize them with the
Company's vision, mission, values, operations, challenges,

structure, risks and sustainability initiatives. Additionally,

as part of our continuous familiarization process, Directors
receive regular updates on significant regulatory and industry
developments through a formal reporting mechanism.

In accordance with the provisions of Regulation 25 of the
SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)
Regulations, 2015, the Company has established a

comprehensive Familiarization Programme for its Independent

Directors. This programme is designed to ensure that
Independent Directors are equipped with the necessary
knowledge and understanding to effectively discharge their

duties and responsibilities in the best interests of the Company

and its Stakeholders. The Familiarization Programme
is structured into two key components: ‘Induction’ and
‘Ongoing Interaction’.

The Induction Programme is tailored to familiarize new
Non-Executive Directors with the Company's operations,
governance structure and business environment.

The invitation to attend these sessions is extended to the
existing Directors as well.

They are imparted with an in-depth understanding of the
Company’s history, mission, vision, business model and

its key products & services. Additionally, the Company's
organisational structure, strategic objectives and corporate
culture, corporate governance framework, including its
policies, codes of conduct and compliance procedures are
well demonstrated and discussed. This includes an overview
of the Company’s internal controls, risk management
processes, and the legal & regulatory requirements that
govern the Company’s operations. These sessions gives the
Directors a platform to interact with the Senior Leadership of
the Company.

In line with the Company's strategic focus on sustainability
and digital transformation, all Directors are equipped with
iPads to facilitate paperless board meetings. These devices
provide secure access to a comprehensive repository of
materials, including:

Meeting documents and presentations

+

+

+ Approved policies, charters and governance frameworks
Adirectory of Specific Points of Contact (SPOCs) for
addressing relevant queries

+

The SPOC directory enables Directors to engage directly with
members of the Senior Leadership Team, ensuring timely
and effective resolution of queries. This direct access fosters
a deeper understanding of the Company’s operations and
constraints, while promoting meaningful interaction with
subject matter experts across key business functions.

This initiative not only enhances operational efficiency but
also reinforces the Company's commitment to environmental
responsibility, governance excellence, and informed
decision-making

1. Ongoing Interaction Programmes:

To ensure that the Directors are well acquainted with the

Company’s endeavors and to equip them to be effective in their

respective roles, the Company facilitates ongoing interactions
and learning opportunities. Some of the highlights have been
elaborated below.

During the year, the following sessions were conducted:

Objective of the Programme:

The primary goal of the Familiarization Programme is to
enable Directors to gain a thorough understanding of the
business, operations and strategic priorities of the Company.
Through this process, they can interact closely with the
Senior Leadership of the Company and get a comprehensive
and balanced perspective on the strategic issues facing the
Company, the competitive differentiation being pursued by
the Company and an overview of the execution plan. By doing
so, the programme ensures that Directors can contribute
meaningfully to Board discussions, provide valuable insights
and take well-informed decisions. It also empowers Directors
to fulfill their oversight functions effectively and safeguard the
interests of the Company and its Stakeholders.

During the plant visit organized for the Directors, a series of
comprehensive sessions were conducted to provide an in-
depth overview of the plant’s key operations. These sessions
covered key areas of plant operations, including aluminium
production, captive power generation, flat rolled products,
safety protocols and township management. The Directors
also engaged directly with job workers, gaining firsthand
insights and hands-on exposure to the plant's established
operational processes.

As part of the Company’s digital transformation journey,

the Directors were introduced to the evolution of various
processes—from manual operations in the early years to the
current state of automation and digitalisation. They were also
briefed on upcoming digital initiatives that are either in the
planning phase or currently being implemented.

The visit concluded with a detailed product walk-through and
an exclusive session following the unveiling of Hindalco’s
refreshed brand identity. This session offered the Directors
adeeper understanding of the Company’s product portfolio,
market presence, customer base, and strategic initiatives. The
Directors were also apprised on the special emphasis that was
placed on efforts to revive and support local artisans, as well
as the Company’s ongoing commitment to sustainability.

Through this structured approach to induction and ongoing
learning, the Company ensures that its Directors are
continuously well-prepared to address evolving challenges
and contribute to the Company’s long-term success.

Executive / Non-Executive Remuneration

Remuneration Philosophy: Your Company's Executive
Remuneration Philosophy supports the design of programs
that align executive rewards — including incentive programs,
retirement benefit programs, promotion and advancement
opportunities, with the long-term success of your
Company's Stakeholders.

The executive remuneration policy is designed to attract,
retain and reward talented executives who contribute to your
Company’s long-term success and thereby build value for

its Stakeholders. It reflects our commitment to attracting,
retaining and rewarding exceptional leadership talent capable
of driving sustainable performance in a competitive and
evolving business landscape.

Our approach to executive remuneration is grounded in the
principle of aligning the interests of executives with those
of our Shareholders. By placing a strong emphasis on “pay
for performance,” the policy ensures that reward outcomes
are closely tied to the achievement of both Company-wide
strategic objectives and individual performance goals.

Remuneration is considered holistically, combining both
monetary and non-monetary components to offera
well-rounded, competitive package. This includes fixed
remuneration, variable incentives linked to performance and

a range of benefits that support the overall well being and
engagement of our executive team. Through this structure, we
aim to foster a high-performance culture that is aligned with the
Company’s values and strategic direction.

The policy is reviewed regularly to ensure it remains fit for
purpose, reflects market best practices, and complies with
evolving governance standards. Oversight by the Board and
relevant committees ensures that remuneration outcomes are
fair, responsible and transparent.

We remain committed to maintaining a remuneration
framework that is robust, aligned with Shareholders’ interests
and capable of supporting the long-term ambitions of

our Company.

Executives’ pay practices and levels are dynamically tracked
and aligned with peer Companies in similar global industries,
geographies, size and function. Your Company aims to provide
competitive remuneration opportunities to its executives by
positioning target total remuneration {including perks and benefits,
annual incentive pay-outs, jong term incentive payouts at target performance}
and target total cash compensation finciuding annuat incentive
pay-outs] at target performance directionally between median
and top quartile of the primary talent market. It recognises

the size and scope of the role and the market standing,

skills and experience of incumbents while positioning its
executives. Your Company uses secondary market data only
as areference point for determining the types and amount

of remuneration while principally believing that target total
remuneration packages should reflect the typical cost of
comparable executive talent available in the sector. For
detailed Remuneration Policy please visit www.hindalco.com.

Components of Remuneration: The remuneration involves
a balance between fixed and incentive pay, reflecting short
and long-term performance objectives appropriate to the
working of your Company and its goals. A material proportion
of compensation for Senior Management is performance
based - 25% to 40% of compensation. It increases as the
employee grows in the organisation and takes up roles

of higher responsibility. The more senior the role, the
weightage of business performance on the variable pay also
increases in comparison to unit performance and individual
performance. This ensures a competitive pay-mix which aims
to strike the appropriate balance between key components:
(i) Fixed Cash compensation (Basic Salary + Allowances)

(ii) Annual Incentive Plan (iii) Long-Term Incentives (iv) Perks
and Benefits.

Annual incentive plan pay-outs of executives are linked to
relevant financial and operational metrics achievement such
as return on capital expenditure, return on invested capital,
return on equity, ESG performance and their individual
performance. Financial and operational metrics are annually
aligned with priorities / focus areas for the business.
Long-term incentive plans incentivise stretch performance,
link executive remuneration to sustained long term growth
and act as aretention and reward tool. Stock options are
used as the primary long-term incentive vehicles as your
Company believes that they best align executive incentives
with stakeholder interests. ESOPs are allocated based on
Company’s performance while also comparing the Total
Shareholder Return f-TsR”} with the performance of peer
companies {i.e. indian and global peer companies}. The period to
determine the stock options is 3 years of all the performance-
based incentives and the options shall be vested after a
maximum period of 4 years. Your Company also grants
performance stock units as a secondary long term incentive
vehicle, to motivate and retain its executives.

Details of remuneration paid to directors during the
financial year 2024-25:

Executive Directors: The NRC while recommending to the
Board the remuneration of Executive Directors, considers
the performance of the business, individual performance,
practices followed in other similar sized global Companies,
among others, while also ensuring that the remuneration is in
compliance with the terms and conditions of appointment as
approved by the Members and the Executive Remuneration
Policy of the Company. All decisions relating to the
remuneration of Executive Directors is taken by the Board
based on the remuneration policy and in terms of the resolution
passed by the Members of your Company.

Exposure. Under the Offset Hedge Program, we use derivative products to eliminate the price risk arising due to
timing mismatch whereas for Strategic View Based exposure, derivative instruments are used to manage the price
risk for future tenor. Hedging is done for commodities where an active derivative market exists.

Social Report

The changing face of women

Let me begin with, a spoo! back to a few lines, penned by
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, one of the phenomenal
poets of nineteenth-century America, and ! quote:

“For it is the fate of awoman
Long fo be patient and silent

To wait like a ghost that is speechless
Till some questioning voice

Dissolves the spell of its silence”. Unquote
And look at where, we women stand today.

Amazing how we in India, stand out on major counts. And
most certainly on women empowerment processes. The
Government in india is heavily invested, in the economic
empowerment of women, for over a decade now. This is
an exciting trend.

There is a genuine endeavor, across the globe, both at

the Government's level, and equally so, in progressive
corporates, to recognize women. They have begun to
reckon, that women bring a lot to the table. Their creativity,
out-of-the-box thinking, their leadership, their resilience,

and sensitivity, enable them to make a definite impact.

As this year rolled on, the Fortune 500 heralded a
milestone: For the first time in history, women ran more
than 10% of the businesses on the list of America’s
largest public companies. in effect, women run 10.4%
of companies on the Fortune 500 this year. So, itis
happening, albeit a tad slow, but a beginning has been

made.

In India, women representation on Boards, is 18%.
What is encouraging, is that consequent fo the debate
on Board diversity in india, today, more than 40% of the
companies have gone beyond the mandated limit, and
have appointed more than one woman on the Board.

In spite of the visible progress, at the global and national
level, that much remains to be done is indisputable.

! venture to offer broad-based suggestions. Firstly, we
need to break the stereotyping of women, at two levels —
personal and the image that most men harbour. It’s high
time that men stopped making decisions for women - in
other words, stopped ‘parenting’ and ‘mansplaining’
them. Truth be told, women who have risen to a level,
have proved to be equally capable, ambitious and
responsible. They manage their homes, and their
children, along with their work. Gender sensitivity and
awareness discourses, can drive home this aspect.
Always look through a positive frame. Men must play

a proactive role of being an ally in fighting biases, and
obstacles at work, and in helping women break the glass
ceiling. A case in point is the insufficient access and
financial exciusion by Venture Capitalists — just 2%. We
must alter the algorithm.

At the base level, most mothers need to shake off, the
thought that science, technology, engineering and
mathematics are good for boys and not for girls. So, the
daughter is encouraged to move in softer areas, devoid
of technical skills. And this kind of differential upbringing,
becomes a roadblock and a self-limiting belief. More
recently, STEM education has been mainstreamed, in the
study programmes and that augurs well.

There are two more points that ! would like to highlight

— first, what are we doing as an MNC, operating in 41
countries, with an employee base of 187,000 employees,
spanning 100 nationalities. And second, what is shaping,
the empowerment trajectory in our country.

At the Aditya Birla Group, we have developed a playbook,
fixated on a holistic approach, that truly perpetuates
women leaders. Our endeavor is to make Aditya Birla
Group, an aspirational workplace for women, and
increasingly weave women into mainstream operations,
in the near future. We have long begun enhancing

the representation of women at leadership levels,

across operations, be it management, manufacturing,

marketing, branding, sales, or research. We are making

good progress. Currently, we have over 200 women, in

senior and top leadership roles.

For us it is a journey of transformation. Our Chairman has
pushed the agenda, and today it is like a movement. To
drive a mindset of inclusion, we have worked out diverse
innovative programmes, among which are immersive
workshops, interactive manager sensitization and digital

learning sessions.

The outcomes have been very fulfilling. A clear signal
is beamed - emphasizing the fact, that given everything
being equal, the scale must tilt towards women. ina
few years ahead, we would be on the top of the pole in
the context of women empowerment. fam sure, most
progressive corporates, serious in pursuing gender
equity, would have made ‘women empowerment’ a
business case.

Moving next on to government initiatives to mentor
women, and leverage their potential, the Government of
India, genuinely believes that women led development is
integral to India’s progress. A slew of schemes that focus

on education, healthcare, financial inclusion, among

others, have made a phenomenal! difference to the status
of women, both in rural and urban areas.

These relate fo women-led entrepreneurship, property
rights, inheritance laws, ownership of wealth, besides
education and agriculture reforms. ina meticulous
manner, these open the door, to the journey of self-
reliance and empowerment. It has helped forge a seif-
actualization path, for thousands of women. To cite an
example, there are over 8.59 lakh women Micro, Small
and Medium Enterprises registered. ! believe, we can add
up fo over 18% to our nation’s GDP, which today stands at

nearly 4 trillion dolfars.

Let me conclude in the words of our Honourable Prime
Minister, Shri Narendra Modiji: “Global development is
not possible without women’s participation”. We heed the

message. What more can one say!

Our forward march: A brief narrative of our CSR
engagement

It might interest you to learn that Hindalco is equally
committed to empower women. Today Hindalco has a cohort
of 71 women leaders, 10% of its management staff comprises
of women and two of its plants globally are headed by women.
The number of women in the organization has grown by 10
times in the last 10 years. We are also happy to share that
Hindalco set up its own Women ERG in 2024, comprising of
11 members who will contribute towards making Hindalco a
remarkable workplace where diversity thrives.

Glimpses of our work in the developmental domains:

SDG-1: To rid poverty across all nations by 2030

Our CSR engagement is pivoted on the enrichment of the
lives of the underprivileged. Our process comprises of
training and empowering them to become self-reliant and
lead lives of dignity and respect. It extends across our 24
manufacturing inclusive of mining units. These crisscross
12 states. Among these feature West Bengal, Jharkhand,
Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat,
Odisha, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala,
and the Union Territories of Dadra & Nagar Haveli and
Daman & Diu.

SDG-2: To end all forms of hunger and
malnutrition by 2030:

To boost agricultural and horticultural activities and improve
overall farm productivity, we organized 376 camps across
Dahej, Singrauli, Lohardaga, Garepaima, Belagavi,
Renukoot, Muri, Kathautia and Renusagar. Consequently
6,797 farmers have adopted advanced agricultural practices.
These camps focused on doable interventions such as
demonstration plots, soil testing, distribution of quality seeds,
training on inter-cropping techniques, and exposure visits to
agricultural universities.

Additionally, in Jnarkhand, over 1,361 farmers from the
districts of Gumia, Latehar and Lohardaga received quality
seeds of ragi and other millets. It enabled them cultivate
1,527 acres of land. This initiative led to a 20% jump in
income. It also facilitated linkage with the Jnarkhand State
Livelihood Promotion Society, which enlarge market access
considerably for the farmers.

Additionally, during agriculture support programmes held in
Renukoot, Singrauli, Dahej and Lohardaga, we distributed

agricultural tools, seeds, fertilizers, and crop protection
materials to around 5,000 farmers. These inputs were widely
appreciated and contributed to improved crop quality and
yield.

Vermi Compost

Farmer Clubs were successfully initiated at Renukoot and
Lohardaga, bringing together 972 farmers under a structured
network to promote collective growth and knowledge
sharing.

In Renukoot and Muri, 51 lift irrigation facilities benefitted 836
farmers, ensuring consistent water availability. Consequently,
farmers were able to cultivate a second crop, effectively
doubling their income in many cases.

Under the Social Forestry Programme, 2,20,800 saplings
were distributed across Belur, Samri, Renukoot, Lohardaga,
Taloja, Kathuatia, Garepalma, Silvassa, Belagavi, Maliparbat
and Chakia, promoting ecological balance and community
participation in greening efforts.

Lac cultivation was introduced on over 25,000 host plants
by 76 farmers from Latehar, Gumia and Garepaima. With
acommercial tie-up in place, this initiative has significantly
improved household incomes, generating an average of

% 30,000 annually per farmer.

Vocational skills training programs was yet another
substantial benefit for 1,546 locals. The geographies
include Renukoot, Renusagar, Singrauli, Lohardaga,

Muri, Matiparbat, Taloja, Samri, Kathuatia, Belagavi,
Garepaima, Chakia and Silvassa. The impact is palpable
as unemployment has whittled. Many youngsters now have
a job and many have moved forward to set up their mini
enterprises.

A state-of-the-art Aditya Birla Skills Centre has been set up in
Sambaipur. Intense training was imparted to 96 persons, of

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Social Report

At our 9 Aditya Birla Public Schools in Renukoot, Renusagar
and Muri, 4,455 rural students are enrolled, while 2,054
students attend 5 Aditya Birla Vidya Mandirs at Renukoot,
Kathautia and Samri.

Under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, we partnered with 93
primary schools in Lohardaga, Renukoot, Garepaima,
Belagavi, Tafoja and Silvassa, reaching out to 30,331
students. Education kits were distributed to 8,623 children
across 389 schools, supporting foundational learning. To
address the shortage of teaching staff, we recruited and
deputed 27 teachers to primary and secondary schools

in Lohardaga and Dahej. We conducted drawing, debate,
sports, and cultural events in 50 schools, engaging 3,079
students in holistic development activities.

Our Mahan Jyoti Scholarship Programme supported 201
meritorious students this year.

To curb dropout rates among secondary school girls in Dahej,
Lohardaga, Samri, Garepalma and Muri, we arranged bus
transport for 684 students, enabling them to continue their
education safely. We actively collaborated with 8 Kasturba
Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas [KGBvs] at Renukoot, Lohardaga
and Muri, supporting the education of 2,354 girls.

At 53 non-formal education centres in Lohardaga, 128
students have been enrolled. Furthermore, 90 adults are
students once again in 3 adult literacy programmes at
Renusagar and Kathautia.

In the realm of digital literacy, we run 23 computer education
centres at Renusagar, Belur, Kathautia, Belagavi, Chakla,
Silvassa and Singrauli, benefiting 209 rural students.

We have introduced smart classes in 12 schools, reaching
over 21,903 students with interactive digital learning content

aligned with school curricula. This has improved clarity in
understanding amongst students.

Through 23 career counselling camps at Singrauli, Renukoot,
Lohardaga, Kathautia, Belagavi, Maliparbat, Taloja, Chakia
and Silvassa, 5,275 students received guidance on career
pathways. Many have since enrolled in technical and
vocational training programmes.

Similarly, at Birla Copper, Project ASTITVA is being
implemented for 180 persons across five villages in Dahej
with a focused commitment to supporting individuals with
special needs—particularly elderly persons and women
with disabilities. We also organised 3 camps specifically for
children with special needs at Renukoot. This continued
intervention has helped in deepening social and economic
inclusion, ensuring the empowerment and meaningful
participation of persons with disabilities in their
communities.

Renovation of school building

Infrastructure development remains a key focus. We
established 2 libraries at Garepaima, constructed 3
classrooms at Singrauli and Garepaima, and repaired 21
school buildings at Renukoot, Singrauli, Lohardaga, Belagavi
and Tafoja. Additionally, we provided furniture to 23 schools at
Taloja, Maliparbat, Renukoot and Belagavi.

To improve sanitation and hygiene, 4 sanitation blocks were
built at Befur, Singrauli and Lohardaga. Safe drinking water
facilities have been made available at 15 schools in Belur,
Lohardaga, Garepalma and Matiparbat. This has resulted in
significant increase in enrolment and retention of children at
School, especially in higher classes and reduced drop out.

SDG-5: Women empowerment and gender
equality:

The 1,727 Self-Help Groups {SHGsj established by us have
empowered 23,177 households, fostering both economic
and social upliftment. More than 50% SHGs are engaged
in gainful income generation activity and making a descent
income to support her family.

Garment Manufacturing Unit

The sixth, seventh and eighth SDGs, center on water and
sanitation, reliable, sustainable, modern energy, decent
work, and economic growth.

In partnership with the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, we leveraged
government schemes, facilitated community and contributed
our own funds to support in constructing 673 toilets across

Renukoot, Renusagar, Singrauli and Lohardaga. To further
support the Government's efforts in achieving ODF Plus
status, we launched Project Lighthouse, a Solid Liquid Waste
Management initiative by FICCI, in 6 Gram Panchayats.

As part of our commitment to the Green Energy movement,
we have installed 75 solar-powered lights across Renusagar,
Lohardaga and Maliparbat. Additionally, 720 solar lanterns
have been distributed across Renusagar, Samri, Kathautia
and Chakia units, ensuring that students can study without
interruptions throughout the year.

6. The following Key Audit Matters were included in in the Memorandum of Work Performed issued by other auditor whose
audit report dated May 16, 2025, contained an unmodified audit opinion on the Fit-for-consolidation consolidated

financial statements of Novelis Inc. (“Novelis”), a subsidiary of the Holding Company which is reproduced by us as under:

Key audit matter

Goodwill impairment assessment — North America
cash generating unit

The Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was

% 26,648 Crores as of March 31, 2025, and the goodwill
related to the North America cash generating unit was

% 12,469 Crores. Management conducts an impairment
test as of the last day of March of each year, or more
frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. As disclosed
by management, potential impairment is identified by
comparing the recoverable value of each cash generating
unit to its carrying value. The Company estimates the
recoverable value based on fair value less costs to sell.

If the carrying value exceeds the recoverable value,
management records an impairment charge in an amount
equal to that excess. Fair value for each cash generating
unit as of the testing date is based on a weighted average
of the value indication from the income and market
approaches. The income approach is dependent ona
number of significant management assumptions including
sales volumes, conversion premiums, and discount rate.
The market approach is dependent on the significant
assumption for the selection of multiples.

The principal considerations for our determination that
performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment
assessment of the North America cash generating unit

is a Key Audit Matter are (i) the significant judgment by
management when developing the fair value estimate of
the North America cash generating unit; (ii) a high degree
of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing
procedures and evaluating management’s significant
assumptions related to sales volumes, conversion
premiums, and the discount rate used in the income
approach, and selection of multiples used in the market
approach; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of
professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

11.

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered

material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism
throughout the audit. We also:

. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our
opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated
financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. (Refer paragraph 15 below)

. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
related disclosures made by management.

. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast
significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its associates and joint ventures to continue as a going concern.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the
related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However,
future events or conditions may cause the Group, its associates and joint ventures to cease to continue as a going
concern.

. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in
a manner that achieves fair presentation.

. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial statements/ financial information of the entities
or business activities within the Group, its associates and joint ventures to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial
statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent
auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by other
auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried
out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the
consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that
we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with
relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters
that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit
matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the

matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report
because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of
such communication.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial statements

6.

A Company’s internal financial control with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial control with reference

to financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial
statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or
fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference
to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to financial
statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion

8.

In our opinion, the Holding Company, and its joint operations, subsidiaries, joint venture and an associate, which are
companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with
reference to financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established

by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

We report that the auditors of three associates have given the following opinion in report on the Internal Financial Control
with reference to the Financial Statement under clause (i) of sub — section 3 of Section 143 of the Act of their respective
companies that are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Holding Company:

internal control over financial reporting criteria
established by the Company considering the
essential components of internal control stated in
the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial
Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘the
Guidance Note’), the operating effectiveness

of such process controls and appropriate
documentation thereof needs to be strengthened
to make the same commensurate with the size

of the Company and nature of its business. The
enhancements required in the design and the
operating effectiveness of the internal financial
control system with reference to financial
statements does not affect our opinion on the
financial statements of the Company.

Other Matter

financial controls with reference to financial statements insofar as it relates to two joint operations, twelve subsidiaries,
four associates and one joint venture, which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports
of the auditors of such companies incorporated in India. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

(xvii) In our opinion and on the basis
of available Financial Statements
subjected to audit, the company has
incurred cash losses in the current
Financial Year and in the immediately
preceding Financial Year. The figures
of Current Financial Year and the
Previous Financial Year are ¥ & &
respectively.

(xix) As per the information and
explanations obtained and on the
basis of reasonable scrutiny of books
of account and available records, we
are of the opinion that there exists
material uncertainty on the date of
the audit report that the company is
not capable of meeting its liabilities
existing at the date of Balance Sheet
as and when they fall within a period of
one year from the balance sheet date.

In our opinion there is no possibility
that the Company would ever be

able to pursue its object in future

also because of prevailing material
uncertainty with respect to operations.
The Net worth of the Company

has also been eroded fully and the
Company is only thriving on the

funds of the holding company for its
expenses.

The Group is engaged in various arrangements on a joint basis with other companies. The principal place of business
is also their country of incorporation for all the joint operations. In assessing whether joint control exists for these
arrangements, the management evaluates the structure and legal framework and contracts governing the arrangement
combined with an assessment of those decisions that significantly influence the return from the arrangement. The
Group assesses whether joint arrangements are joint operations where the Group has rights to the assets and
obligations for the liabilities related to the arrangement, or a joint venture where the Group has an interest in the net
assets of the joint arrangement. Accordingly, the following joint arrangements have been identified as joint operations:

and losses, shareholder voting, management control, and rights to use the production capacity of the facility.

Logan Aluminum Inc (“Logan”), an aluminum rolling mill in Kentucky, is a joint operation between Novelis
and Tri-Arrows Aluminum Inc. ("“Tri-Arrows”). Logan processes metal exclusively received from Novelis and
Tri-Arrows and charges the respective partner a fee to cover expenses. This indicates that both Novelis and
Tri-Arrows get substantially all of the economic benefits from the assets of the joint arrangement. Logan is
thinly capitalized and relies on the regular reimbursement of costs and expenses by Novelis and Tri-Arrows
to fund its operations, indicating that Novelis and Tri-Arrows have an obligation for the liabilities of the
arrangement. Other than these contractually required reimbursements, Novelis do not provide other material
support to Logan. Logan’s creditors do not have recourse to our general credit. Novelis has a 40% voting
interest; however, our participating interest in operation ranges from greater than 50% to approximately 55%
depending on output. Novelis has joint ability to make decisions regarding Logan’s production operations

non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of gain or loss on change in fair value of
the item (i.e. translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also
recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).

The Group has determined current and non-current classification of its assets and liabilities in the financial statements
as per the Group's normal operating cycle, and other criteria set out in Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013. Based
on the nature of products and the time lag between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash
and cash equivalents, the Group has ascertained its normal operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose of current
and non-current classification of its assets and liabilities.

Items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which that entity operates (functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented

in Indian Rupees (“z *) which is the functional currency of the Parent. All values presented in Indian Rupees has

been rounded off to nearest Rupees Crore (¥ 1 Crore = = 10,000,000) without any decimal, unless otherwise stated.
Amounts below rounding off convention or equal to zero are represented as “-” in the consolidated financial statements.

The Group determines materiality depending on the nature or magnitude of information, or both. Information is material
if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably influence decisions made by the primary users, on the basis of
those financial statements.

Accounting policy information

The material accounting policies adopted in preparation of the consolidated financial statements has been disclosed in
the pertinent note along with other information in italics. All accounting policies has been consistently applied to all the
periods presented in the consolidated financial statements unless otherwise stated.

Principles of consolidation

The consolidated financial statement comprises the financial statements of the parent and entities controlled by

the parent i.e. subsidiaries, Jointly controlled operations and trusts. It also includes the Group’s share of profits, net
assets and retained post acquisition reserves of joint ventures and associates that are consolidated using the equity or
proportionate method of consolidation, as applicable.

Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are the entities (including structured and unstructured entities) over which the Group has control.

The Group controls an entity when the group is exposed to or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement

with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the

entity. Consolidation of the subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the
Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of
during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains the control until the
date the Group ceases to contral the subsidiary.

The Group combines the financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries line by line adding together like

items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised profits

on transactions between group companies are eliminated in full. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the
transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred assets. Appropriate adjustments for deferred taxes
are made for temporary differences that arise from the elimination of unrealised profits and losses from intra-group
transactions or undistributed earnings of Group’s entity included in consolidated statement of profit and loss, if any.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other
events in similar circumstances.

Achange in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.
This results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect
their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling
interests and any consideration paid or received is recognised within equity attributable to owners of the parent.

Interest in Associates and Joint Ventures

An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate
in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies,
generally accompanying a shareholding between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.

A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the
net assets of the joint arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement,
which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.

The Group's interest in its associates or joint ventures are accounted for using the equity methad from the date on
which the investee becomes an associate or a joint venture. Under equity method, the investment in an associate ora
joint venture is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the changes in the Group's share of net
assets of the associate or joint venture since the acquisition date. Dividends received or receivable from associates
and joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. On acquisition of the
investment in an associate or a joint venture, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group's share of the
net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognised as Goodwill, which is included within
the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets
and liabilities over the cost of the investment is recognised in equity as Capital Reserve in the period in which the
investment is acquired.

Interest in Joint Operations

A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the
assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of
control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of
the parties sharing control.

When a Group entity undertakes its activities under joint operations, the Group entity as a joint operator recognises in
relation to its interest in a joint operation:

« its assets, including its share of any assets held jointly;

« its liabilities, including its share of any liabilities incurred jointly;

« its revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising from the joint operation;
« its share of the revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation; and

« its expenses, including its share of any expenses incurred jointly.

Translation of foreign operations

The results and financial positions of the foreign operations that have functional currency other than INR are translated
in INR, as follows:

. assets, liabilities and equity (except for retained earnings) are translated at closing rate of the balance sheet date.
Retained earnings to be carried at historical cost;

. income and expenses are translated at period average exchange rate;
. all resulting exchange difference are recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity.

. accumulated exchange differences arising from translation and attributable to non-controlling interests are
allocated to, and recognised as part of, non-controlling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

On the disposal of a foreign operation all of the exchange differences accumulated in OCI relating to that particular
foreign operation attributable to the owners of the Group is reclassified in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation that does not result in
the Group losing control over the subsidiary, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are re-
attributed to non-controlling interests and are not recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. For
partial disposals of investment in associates or joint arrangements that do not result in the Group losing significant
influence or joint control, the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified in the
consolidated statement of profit and loss.

Any goodwill and fair value adjustments arising in business combinations or acquisition of a foreign operation are
treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting
date and resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.

The Group combines the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to its interest in a joint operation with the
particular assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of its own.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
New and amended standards adopted by the Group

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs vide notification dated 09 September, 2024 and 28 September, 2024 notified the
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Second Amendment Rules, 2024 and Companies (Indian Accounting
Standards) Third Amendment Rules, 2024, respectively, which amended/ notified certain accounting standards (see
below), and are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 01 April 2024:

. Insurance contracts - Ind AS 117; and
. Lease Liability in Sale and Leaseback - Amendments to Ind AS 116

These amendments did not have any material impact on the amounts recognised in prior periods and are not expected
to significantly affect the current or future periods.

New and amended standards issued but not effective

The Ministry of Corporate affairs vide notification dated 07 May, 2025 notified Companies (Indian Accounting
Standards) Amendment Rules, 2025 which amended Ind AS 21, ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’.
The amendments are not expected to significantly affect the current or future periods.

Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment held for use in the production or/and supply of goods or services, or for administrative
purposes, are stated in the consolidated balance sheet at cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and
subsequent accumulated impairment losses except for freehold land (other than freehold land used for mining) which is
carried at historical cost.

The present value of obligatory decommissioning cost related to assets are included in the initial cost of such assets.
Cost may also include effective portion on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant
and equipment transferred from hedge reserve as basis adjustment.

Subsequent expenditure on major maintenance or repairs includes the cost of the replacement of parts of assets

and overhaul costs. Where an asset or part of an asset is replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits
associated with the item will be available to the Group, the expenditure is capitalised and the carrying amount of the
item replaced is derecognised. Similarly, overhaul costs associated with major maintenance which can be measured
reliably are capitalised as a separate component and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the underlying asset
where it is probable that future economic benefits will be available and any remaining carrying amounts of the cost of
previous overhauls are derecognised. All other costs are charged to consolidated statement of profit and loss during
the reporting period in which they are incurred.

The Group based on the technical assessment made by the technical expert/ management estimate, depreciate
certain items of building, plant and equipments over the estimated useful lives which are different from the useful life
prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. The management believes that these estimated useful lives are
realistic and reflect fair approximation of the period over which the assets are likely to be used.

The Group reviews the estimated residual values and expected useful lives of assets at least annually. In particular,
the Group considers the impact of the health, safety and environmental legislation in its assessment of expected
useful lives and estimated residual values. Furthermore, the Group considers environment-related matters, including
physical and transition risks. Specifically, the Group determines whether environment-related legislation and
regulations might impact either the useful lives or residual values.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Items of Property, Plant and Equipments Useful life*
Freehold Land Infinite *
Leasehold Improvements 7-90 Years
Buildings 3-60 Years
Plant and Machinery 2-40 Years
Vehicles and Aircraft 2-25 Years
Railway Wagons 15 Years
Railway Sidings 15 Years
Furniture and Fixtures 3-10 Years
Office Equipment 2-25 Years

$ Freehold land used for mining which is depreciated over 8 - 30 years.

* Cost incurred subsequent to capitalisation, accounted as a separate component, is depreciated over the remaining useful
life of the underlying asset.

The Group accounting policy on depreciation and impairment of non-current assets is described in note 3G and 3H,
respectively.

Right of Use Assets

The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of the contract. The Group recognises a right-
of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease arrangements in which it is the lessee, except for
short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. For short term
leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as other expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term, unless
another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are
consumed. Contingent and variable rentals are recognized as expense in the periods in which they are incurred.

The Right of Use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at
or before the commencement day and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses.

For certain class of assets, the Group allocates lease or non-lease components on the basis of their relative stand-alone
Prices while assessing a contract at its inception or on reassessment.

The Group tests Impairment of right-of-use asset and accounts for any identified impairment loss as per its accounting
policy on ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’.

Extension and termination options are included in many of the leases. in determining the lease term, the management
considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise
a termination option.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for the head lease and sublease as two separate contracts. The
sublease is classified as finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.

Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. 3D. Lease Liabilities
Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased The lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date are discounted using the interest rate implicit in
asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s

incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds
necessary fo obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar
terms, security and conditions.

When a contract includes lease and non-lease components, the Group applies Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers to allocate the consideration under the contract to each component.

The Group accounting policy on depreciation and impairment of non current assets is described in note 3G and 3H,

respectively. To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate 3
adjusted for credit risk and makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, security etc. 5

3F. Other intangible assets and intangible assets under development

intangible assets acquired separately

intangible assets acquired are reported at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.

Mineral reserves, resources and rights (Mining rights)

Mineral reserves, resources and rights (together referred to as ‘mining rights’) which can be reasonably valued, are
recognised in the assessment of fair values on acquisition. Mining rights also include Stripping cost.

Stripping cost

Stripping costs incurred during the mining production phase are allocated between cost of inventory produced and the
existing mine asset. The stripping ratio, as approved by the regulatory authority, for the life of the mine is obtained by
dividing the estimated quantity of overburden by the estimated quantity of mineable coal / bauxite reserve to be extracted
over the life of the mine. This ratio is periodically reviewed and changes, if any, are accounted for prospectively.

Stripping costs are allocated and included as a component of the mine asset when they represent significantly improved
access fo ore, provided all the following conditions are met:

. it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the stripping activity will be realised;
. the component of the ore body for which access has been improved can be identified; and

. the costs relating to the stripping activity associated with the improved access can be reliably measured.

Depreciation and amortisation expense

Property plant and equipments

Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or value of assets, net off their residual values, over their estimated
useful lives. Depreciation is recorded using the straight line basis. The estimated useful lives and residual values are
reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. Each
component of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of that
item is depreciated separately if its useful life differs from the others components of the asset.

Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use. Depreciated assets and accumulated
depreciation accounts are retained fully until they are removed/retired from active use.

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their useful life or the lease term, unless the entity expects to
use the assets beyond the lease term.

For our indian operations, the useful life of the items of Property, Plant and Equipment is based on the technical
assessment by management for the current and comparative period which is in line with the useful life prescribed in
Schedule I! of the Companies Act, 2013.

Right of Use Assets

Right of Use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset
using the straight line basis. If the Group is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is
depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful life. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease.

investment properties

Depreciation is charged on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives.

intangible assets

Amortization is charged on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives other than ‘Mining Rights’ and ‘Carbon
Emission Rights’. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting
period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.

Mining Rights

Exploitable mineral rights are amortised using the unit of production basis over the commercially recoverable reserves.
Commercially recoverable reserves are proved and probable reserves. Mineral resources are included in amortisation
calculations where there is a high degree of confidence that they will be extracted in an economic manner. Changes in the
commercial recoverable reserves affecting unit of production calculations are dealt with prospectively over the revised
remaining reserves.

Carbon Emission

Carbon emission rights are not amortised as their carrying value equals their residual value and therefore the depreciable
base is zero, as their value is constant until delivery to the authorities. Emission allowances are subject to impairment
test. Please refer note 28 for further details.

Amount of asset class-wise depreciation and amortization are set out below:

. Impairment loss/ (reversal) of non-current assets (net)

Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually
for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. Non
current assets other than goodwill are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate

that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less
costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for
which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets
or groups of assets (cash- generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are
reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period.

The Group accounting policy on impairment of Goodwill is described in note 4.

Critical accounting judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The Group assesses conditions that could cause an asset or a Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to become impaired and to
test recoverability of potentially impaired assets. These conditions include changes resulting from market and economic
environment, including internal and external factors such as the Group’s market capitalization, significant changes in the
Group’s planned use of the assets or a significant adverse change in the expected prices, sales volumes or raw material
cost. The identification of CGUs involves judgment, including assessment of where active markets exist, and the level
of interdependency of cash inflows. CGU is usually the individual plant, unless the asset or asset group is an integral
part of a value chain where no independent prices for the intermediate products exist, a group of plants is combined and
managed to serve a common market, or where circumstances otherwise indicate significant interdependencies.

Determination of the recoverable amount involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as
commodity prices and their impact on markets and prices for upgraded products, demand for products, inflation,
operating expenses and tax and legal environment. The Group uses internal business plans, quoted market prices and

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of acquired
companies. Goodwill arising out of business combination is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the
business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGU”)
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

Goodwill is not amortised, instead it is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if indication of impairment
exists. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment

loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the
unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is
not reversed in a subsequent period.

On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on
disposal.

Critical accounting judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use or fair value less cost to self calculations which require
the use of assumptions as directly observable market prices generally do not exist for the Group’s assets. However, fair
value may be estimated based on recent transactions on comparable assets, internal models used by the Group for
transactions involving the same type of assets or other relevant information. Calculation of value in use is a discounted
cash flow calculation based on continued use of the assets in its present condition, excluding potential exploitation of
improvement or expansion potential.

intention to expand in the copper downstream portfolio.

Impairment testing of Goodwill

The recoverable amount of Novelis Segment CGU to which goodwill is allocated for the years ended 31/03/2025
and 31/03/2024 is determined based on fair value (Level 3) less cost to sell calculations, which require the use of
assumptions. For the purpose of impairment testing, the Group allocated goodwill to cash-generating units (CGU)
that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.

The estimate of fair value less cost to sell for each CGU is based on weighted average of discounted cash flows
(the income approach) and/or guideline public company method which considers Enterprise Value (“EV’/EBITDA
multiples of comparable companies adjusted with control premium (the market approach).

Under the income approach, the fair value of each CGU is based on the present value of estimated future cash
flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including markets
and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, capital spending, working capital changes and the
discount rate. The Group estimate future cash flows for each of the CGU based on their respective projections.
These projected cash flows are discounted to the present value using a weighted average cost of capital (discount
rate). The projections are based on both past performance and the expectations of future performance and
assumptions used in current operating plan.

Under the market approach, fair value is calculated based on guideline public company model. Under this model,
the fair value of each CGU is determined based upon comparisons to public companies engaged in similar
businesses. The Group uses the trailing and forward EV/EBITDA multiples. EV is defined as the total of equity
capital plus debt capital. The trailing multiples have been based on the EBITDA of the trailing twelve months
preceding the valuation date and the forward multiples have been based on the one-year and two-year forward
consensus analyst EBITDA estimates as on the valuation date and has been adjusted for control premium.

The calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering five to
nine year period depending upon CGU'’s/ segment financial budgeting process. Cash flows beyond the five to nine-
year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below. The Management has extended the
NNA projections covering a four-year period (the ‘extended projection period’) to account for the Bay Minette.

The key assumptions used in the estimation of the recoverable amount of CGU’s/ segment are set out below.

The values assigned to the key assumptions represent management's assessment of future trends in the relevant
industries and economic environment and have been based on historical data from both external and internat
sources.

(i) | For Novelis segment, the projected cash flows are discounted to the present value using a post-tax weighted
average cost of capital (discount rate) and for other segments, the projected cash flows are discounted
to the present value using a pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (discount rate). The discount rate is
commensurate with the risk inherent in the projected cash flows and reflects the rate of return required by an
investor in the current economic conditions.

(ii) The Group uses specific growth assumptions for each reporting unit based on history and economic
conditions.

(iii) Cost of disposal is assumed to be 4% (31/03/2024: 4%) of the fair value.

(iv) Valuation method for testing the impairment in Aluminium upstream, Aluminium downstream and copper
segment is value in use.

As aresult of the Management's annual goodwill impairment test for the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31,
2024, no goodwill impairment was identified as the recoverable value of the CGUs to wham goodwill was allocated
exceeded their respective carrying amounts as of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024.

Impact of possible changes in key assumptions

The carrying value of goodwill predominantly (approximately 99% of the total goodwill) relates to the goodwill that
arose on the acquisition of Novelis Inc. wherein goodwill has been allocated in four CGUs. The recoverable amount
of each of these four CGUs would not fall below the carrying value if the key assumptions were to change as follow:

As at 31/03/2025 As at 31/03/2024

Financial Assets

All financial assets are recognised on trade date when the purchase of a financial asset is under a contract whose term
requires delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned. Financial assets are
initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets which are classified as at fair value
through profit or loss (FVTPL) at inception. All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at
either amortised cost or fair value.

Classification of financial assets

Financial assets are classified as ‘equity instrument if it is a non-derivative and meets the definition of ‘equity’ for the
issuer. All other non-derivative financial assets are ‘debt instruments’.

Initial recognition and subsequent measurement
Financial assets at amortised cost
The Group measures Debt instruments at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:

1) the asset is held within a business mode! whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows;
and

2) the contractual terms of the instrument give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Debt instruments meeting these criteria are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method
less any impairment, with interest recognised on an effective yield basis in Other income.

Financial assets classified at amortised cost comprises of trade receivables, loans, deposits, matured derivatives
pending realisation, accrued interest and other receivables.

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
A) Equity instrument

At initial recognition, an irrevocable election is made (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate
investments in equity instruments (other than held for trading purpose) at FVTOCI by the Group.

An investment is held for trading if:
1)  ithas been acquired principally for the purpose of selling it in the near term; or

2) — oninitial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together
and has evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or

3) itis aderivative that is not designated in an effective hedge relationship as a hedging instrument or a financial
uarantee.

investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising
from changes in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the ‘Gain/ (Loss) on
Equity instruments FVTOC!’. Where the asset is disposed of, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in
the ‘Gain/ (Loss) on Equity instruments FVTOCT is directly reclassified to retained earnings.

B) Debt instrument
Debt instrument are measured at FVTOCI by the Group if both of the following conditions are met:

1) Debt instrument is held within a business model whose objective is to hold asset in order to collect contractual
cash flows and selling assets; and

2) the contractual terms of the instrument give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
Principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding investment meeting these criteria are subsequently
measured at fair value with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in other comprehensive
income, except for impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains or losses which
are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. interest calculated using the effective interest
method is recognised in the Consolidated statement of profit and loss as Other income. When the debt
instrument is derecognised the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income
is reclassified to the statement of profit and loss as a reclassification adjustment.

Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets that do not meet the criteria of classifying as amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive
income described above, or that meet the criteria but the entity has chosen to designate as at FVTPL at initial recognition,
are measured at FVTPL.

investments in equity instruments are classified as at FVTPL, unless the Group designates an investment that is not held
for trading at FVTOCI at initial recognition.

Financial assets at FVTPL are subsequently measured at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on re-measurement
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. interest income from these financial assets is included in
other income.

impairment of financial assets

On initial recognition of the financial assets, a loss allowance for expected credit loss is recognised in the statement of
profit and loss for debt instruments carried at amortised cost and FVTOCI.

Expected credit losses of a financial instrument is measured in a way that reflects:
1) an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
2) the time value of money; and

3) reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past
events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly
since initial recognition.

While making the assessment, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at
the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the date of initial recognition and
consider reasonable and supportable information, that is available without undue cost or effort, that is indicative of
significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition.

if, at the reporting date, the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the
Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses.
if, the credit risk on that financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the
loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses.

The amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date is
recognised as an impairment loss or gain in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

De-recognition of financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset on trade date only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the
asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the
asset to another entity or when it retains contractual rights to retain contractual cash flows from financial assets, but

assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipient. if the Group neither transfers nor
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group
recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the
financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.

On de-recognition of a financial asset other than in its entirety (e.g. when the Group retains an option to repurchase part of

a transferred asset), the Group allocates the previous carrying amount of the financial asset between the part it continues
fo recognise under continuing involvement, and the part it no longer recognises on the basis of the relative fair values of
those parts on the date of the transfer. The difference between the carrying amount allocated to the part that is no longer
recognised and the sum of the consideration received for the part no longer recognised and any cumulative gain or loss
allocated to it that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the consolidated statement of
profit and loss. A cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is allocated between
the part that continues to be recognised and the part that is no longer recognised on the basis of the relative fair values of
those parts.

Investments, non-current

The Group recognises all Investments as FVTOCI or FVTPL based on its business model and contractual cash flow test.

5C. Loans

(Unsecured, considered good unless otherwise stated)

Loans given by the Group are financial assets and are initially recognised based on the business model for managing
the financial asset and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the loan. They are measured at FVTPL unless it is not
measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI.

The Group measures loans at amortised cost since:
1) the asset is held within a business mode! whose objective is to hold asset in order to collect contractual cash flows; and

2) the contractual terms of the instrument give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal
and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

These loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective interest Rate (EIR) method. Amortised
cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part
of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance income in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

The details of amount outstanding as at reporting date are given below:

5D. Derivatives and hedge accounting

The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forwards, futures, swaps, options etc. to hedge its risks
associated with foreign exchange fluctuation and price risk movement. Risks associated with fluctuation in the price of
the products (copper, aluminium, coal, furnace oif, natural gas, electricity, diesel and precious metals) are minimized by
undertaking appropriate derivative instruments.

The Group also identifies embedded derivatives in certain transactions. Derivatives embedded in other contracts are
treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to their host contracts. in
some cases, the embedded derivatives may be designated in a hedge relationship. The fair values of all such derivative
financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date. Embedded derivatives closely
related to the host contracts are not separated. Derivatives embedded in a host contract that is an asset within the scope
of ind AS 109 are not separated. Derivatives embedded in all other host contract are separated only if the economic
characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of
the host and are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered
in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest. These derivatives
are designated into a hedge relationship if they meet hedge accounting criteria.

The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a Non-Current asset or liability when the residual maturity of the
derivative is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability when the residual maturity of the derivative is less
than 12 months as at the end of the reporting period.

Fair value measurement of derivatives

Fair value of financial derivatives is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, calculated by reference to quoted
price curves and exchange rates as of the balance sheet date whereas options are valued using appropriate option
pricing models by the Group. For Valuation of options, credit spreads are applied where deemed to be significant.

Fair value measurement of embedded derivatives

The Group values embedded derivatives that are separated from the host contract by comparing the forward curve at
contract inception to the forward curve as of the balance sheet date. Changes in the present value of the cash flows
related to the embedded derivative are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet and in the consolidated statement
of profit and loss.

The Group designates commodity hedges of Copper, Gold and Silver at the fair value of recognised assets (or liabilities
or a firm commitment) under fair value hedge. Currency hedges and Commodity hedges of Aluminium business are
designated based on a particular risk associated with the cash flow of recognised assets (or liabilities or a highly probable
forecast transaction) under cash flow hedge.

The Group also applies hedge accounting using certain foreign currency non-derivative monetary items which are used
as hedging instruments for hedging foreign exchange risk.

The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged
items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group
also documents the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Group will assess whether the hedging relationship
meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including its analysis of the sources of hedge ineffectiveness and how it
determines the hedge ratio).

Change in Fair value of derivatives (including embedded derivatives) that are not designated in any hedge relationship as
mentioned above are accounted through the consolidated statement of profit and loss at each reporting date.

Fair value hedge

Changes in the fair value of derivatives (including embedded derivatives) that are designated and qualify as fair value
hedges are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, together with any changes in the fair value of the
hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no
longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from
the hedged risk is amortised to the consolidated statement of profit and loss from that date except for inventory that is
charged to the consolidated statement of profit and loss on sale of goods.

Cash flow hedges

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading cash flow hedging reserve within equity.
The gain or foss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and
loss, and is included in the (Gain) / Loss on change in Fair Value of Derivatives’ line item.

Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumuiated in equity are reclassified to the
Consolidated statement of profit and loss in the periods when the hedged item affects the consolidated statement of
profit and loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results
in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of
the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability as a basis adjustment.

If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes in no longer optimal but the risk management objective of the Group
remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced

by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns

with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated and accounted for in the
consolidated statement of profit and loss at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it
no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated
in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the
consolidated statement of profit and loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss

accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the Consolidated statement of profit and loss.

constructing a common desalination plant (the ‘Plant’) at Dahej Industrial Area in Gujarat through a SPV, having
total estimated cost of € 1,140 crore. The Group's participation is 10% of total capacity. Pending finalisation of the
structure of the SPV, this amount has been recorded under Capital Advance.

(b) Mainly includes unutilised tax credits and claims receivable from Indirect Tax Authorities.

(c) Includes ¥ 192 Crore (Garepalma mines at Chattisgarh < 74 Crore and Kathautia mines in Jnarkhand
118 Crore) [as at 31/03/2024 192 Crore (Garepalma mines ¥ 74 Crore and Kathautia mines € 118 Crore)] towards
appropriation of Performance Bank Guarantee by Nominated Authority (NA). Details are given below :

Gare Palma IV/4 (GP-4), Gare Palma IV/5 (GP-5) and Kathautia coal mines were acquired by the Company through
auction conducted by the Nominated Authority (NA) constituted under the Ministry of Coal, Government of India.
The Parent Company was required to achieve certain efficiency parameters and reach their Peak Rated Capacity
(PRC) during FY 2015-16. Performance security in the form of Performance Bank Guarantees (PBG) of € 318 crore
(for GP-4), € 369 crore (for GP-5) and % 267 crore (for Kathautia) were provided by the Company to NA in this regard.

Due to the various delays on the part of Government Authorities, PRC was achieved by the Company for GP-4 and
GP-5 during FY 2016-17 and for Kathautia during FY 2017-18. Having satisfied itself about achievement of efficiency
parameters/ PRC, NA returned the PBG in respect of GP-4 on 19/06/2017. However, in a volte face action, vide a
letter dated 25/04/2018, NA imposed a penalty equal to 20% of PBG amounting to < 64 Crore for GP-4, = 74 Crore
for GP-5 and = 118 Crore for Kathautia. As the PBG for GP-5 is still with NA, it also appropriated an amount equal

to the penalty from the PBG of the GP-5 mines. For Kathautia Coal Mine only appropriated amount of € 118 crore is
with NA. In terms of agreement, we have not renewed the PBG for the remaining amount.

The above actions were contested by the Company. The Hon'ble Chhattisgarh High Court at Bilaspur has already
given its judgment in favour of the Parent Company in the matter related to GP-5. As per the judgment, Hon’ble
High Court has asked NA to refund the amount appropriated by them and return the PBG to the Parent Company.
The NA had filed an appeal before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The Hon’ble Supreme Court, vide its order dated
23/04/2025, dismissed the appeal and directed the NA to refund the appropriated amount within three months. The
Parent Company's appeal to quash the demand raised by NA in case of GP-4 is yet to be decided and is pending
before the Mines Tribunal at Bilaspur. In case of Kathautia, the Parent Company had preferred a petition before
Mines Tribunal at Ranchi for quashing of appropriation order and the Tribunal had ordered to refund ~ 118 Crore
after holding that the appropriation order was bad. The NA has challenged the Tribunal's order by filing a writ petition
before the Hon’ble High Court of Jnarkhand.

8A. Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of finished goods and work in progress
includes raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads. Costs of inventories include
the transfer from equity any gains/losses on qualifying cash flow hedges for purchases of raw materials.

Cost of raw material, coal and fuel and traded goods comprises of Cost of purchases and also include all other costs
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition and are net of rebates and discounts.

The inventories are measured at fair value only in those cases where the Inventories are designated into a fair value
hedge relationship.

Cost is determined using the weighted average cost basis. However, the same cost basis is applied to all inventories of a
particular class. inventories of stores and spare parts are valued at weighted average cost basis after providing for cost of
obsolescence and other anticipated losses, wherever considered necessary.

Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs
necessary to make the sale.

Materials and other supplies held for use in the production of inventories (finished goods, work-in-progress) are not
written down below cost if the finished products in which they will be used are expected to sell at or above cost.

Critical accounting judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty

Measurement of bulk inventory quantities (such as coal, bauxite, copper concentrates, etc.) lying at yards and work
in progress of precious metals at smelter and refinery is material, complex and involves significant judgement and
estimates resulting from measuring the surface area, dip measurement of materials in tanks/silos, etc.

The Group performs physical counts of the above inventory on a periodic basis using internal/ external experts to perform
volumetric surveys and assessments, basis which the estimate of quantity for these inventories is determined. The
variations noted between book records and physical quantities of the above inventories are evaluated and appropriately
accounted in the books of accounts.

The Group has applied fair value hedge accounting on copper, gold and silver inventories which forms part of
Work-in-Progress and Finished Goods. Fair value hedges are mainly used to hedge the exposure to the change in
fair value of commodity price risks. The fair value adjustment remains part of the carrying value of inventory and is
taken to the Statement of Consolidated Profit and Loss when the inventory is either sold or consumed, Refer Note
5D(a), 5D(d) and 5D(j) for further details.

For Inventories hypothecated against secured short-term borrowings, Refer Note 12B(a) and 12B(b).

Write down of inventories (net of reversal) to net realizable value related to raw materials, work-in-progress and
finished goods amounted to % 584 Crore (31/03/2024: = 593 Crore). The movement in write down of inventories

(net of reversal) to net realizable value are recognized as expense and included in ‘Cost of Material Consumed’ and
‘Changes in Inventories of Finished Goods, Work-in-Progress and Stock-in-Trade’ in the Consolidated Statement of
Profit and Loss.

Inventories in hand include bulk material of coal, bauxite and copper concentrate lying in yards at plants, mines
and precious metals of gold and silver lying at smelter and refinery aggregating to 3,704 Crore (31/03/2024:
% 3,990 Crore)

The Group recognized impairment on inventory amounting of = 101 Crore ($12 million) related to Sierra flooding

Non-current assets classified as held for sale
Non-Current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered

principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the
asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and

customary for sales of such asset (or disposal group) and its sale is highly probable. Management must be committed
to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of
classification.

Non-Current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount
and fair value less costs to sell except for those assets that are specifically exempt under relevant Ind AS. Once the
assets are classified as “Held for sale”, those are not subjected to depreciation till disposal.

An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less

costs to sell.

The details of Non-current assets classified as held for sale as at the reporting date are given below:

2025 and March 31, 2024 % 12 Crore ($1 million) and € 11 Crore ($ 1 million) respectively, relates to one of the

hydroelectric power generation facilities in South America and another plant in Asia.

(ii) During the previous year, the Group has classified certain pots in one of its smelters as ‘held for sale’ (carrying
amount ¥ 15 Crore). These pots were not in operation due to various technological challenges. Further, major
components have deteriorated over the period and are beyond repair or revival. These assets were disposed of

during the current year and have remaining carrying value of € 1 Crore.
(b) The fair value of the assets held for sale approximates the carrying value.

(c) The Company is in the process of disposing the above assets.

Equity share capital

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its
liabilities.

Ordinary shares

Ordinary shares of the Company are classified as equity share capital and are accounted for at par value. Any value

realised over and above par value upon issuance of equity shares are accounted for as ‘Securities Premium’ under other

equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new ordinary shares, share options and buyback are
recognized as a deduction from other equity, net of any tax effects.

12D. Supplier’s credit

Supplier’s credit represents the extended interest bearing credit offered by the supplier which is secured against the
Usance Letter of Credit (LC). Under this arrangement, the supplier is eligible to receive payment from the negotiating
bank prior to the expiry of the extended credit period. The interest for the extended credit period payable to the bank on
the maturity of the LC has been presented under Finance Cost.

Critical accounting judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The Group participates in various supply chain finance programs under which participating suppliers may voluntarily elect
to sell some or all of their Group receivables to third-party financial institutions. Supplier participation in the programs
is solely up to the supplier, and participating suppliers enter their arrangements directly with the financial institutions.
The Group derecognises financial liability when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. A
significant amount of management judgement is involved in such arrangements to determine when an existing financial
liability is replaced by another on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a
new liability.

12E. Trade payables

Trade payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group and are unpaid at the end of the
reporting period. The amounts are unsecured and usually paid within time limits as contracted. Trade payables are
presented as current liabilities unless the payment is not due within 12 months after the reporting period.

They are recognised initially at their transactional value which represents the fair value and subsequently measured
at amortised cost using the effective interest method wherever applicable. Trade Payables arising out of a contract
containing one or more embedded derivatives, and eligible for designation in its entirety as per Ind-AS 109 Financial
instruments, are subsequently measured at FVTPL.

(d) The Group participates in various supply chain finance programs under which participating suppliers may voluntarily
elect to sell some or all of their Novelis receivables to third-party financial institutions. Supplier participation in the
programs is solely up to the supplier, and participating suppliers enter their arrangements directly with the financial
institutions. The Company and its suppliers agree on the contractual terms for the goods and services it procure,
including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in these
programs. Our suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in these programs has no bearing on our payment terms.
Further, we have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in these programs. The payment terms
that we have with our suppliers range up to 180 days and are considered commercially reasonable. At March 31,
2025 and March 31, 2024, confirmed supplier invoices that are outstanding and subject to the third party programs
included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets were ¥ 7,264 Crore ($850 million) and % 5,102
Crore ($612 million), respectively. We do not believe that future changes in the availability of supply chain financing
will have a significant impact on our liquidity.

(e) Refer Note 39 for reclassification of previous year amounts in current year.

Provisions

Provisions are recognized when there is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is
probable (“more likely than not”) that it is required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the
amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation

at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is
measured using the estimated cash flows to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those

(a) The Code on Social Security, 2020 (‘Code’) in India relating to employee benefits during employment and post
employment benefits received Presidential assent in September 2020. The Cade has been published in the Gazette
of India. However, the date on which the Code will come into effect has not been notified. The Group will assess the
impact of the Code when it comes into effect and will record any related impact in the period the Code becomes
effective.

(b) The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India by their order dated February 28, 2019, in the case of Surya Roshani Limited
v/s EPFO, set out the principles based on which allowances paid to the employees should be identified for inclusion
in basic wages for the purposes of computation of Provident Fund contribution. The Group has given effect of the
above judgement effective March 1, 2019. This does not have any material impact on the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

14B. Employee benefits obligation

Retirement benefit, medical costs and termination benefits

A defined contribution planis a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets
to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Payments to defined
contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling
them to the contributions.

For defined benefit retirement and medical plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit
credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. The present value

of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using market yields of
government bonds having terms approximating to the terms of related obligation. In countries where there is a deep market
in high-quality corporate bonds, the market rate on those bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits
will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation are used.

Re-measurement, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable)
and the return on pian assets (excluding interest), is reflected in the consolidated balance sheet with a charge or credit
recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Re-measurement recognised in other
comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to the Consolidated
statement of profit and loss. Past service cost is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period
of a plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net
defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows:

. service cost (includes current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and
settlements);

. net interest expense or income; and

*  re-measurement.

The Group recognised the first two components of defined benefit costs in the consolidated statement of profit and loss
under employee benefits expense. Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past service costs.

The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated balance sheet represents the actual deficit or surplus
in the Group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any
economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.

A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of
the termination benefit or when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs which involves the payment of
termination benefits.

in the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on the
number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting
period are discounted to their present value.

Short-term and other long-term employee benefits

A liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries in the period the related
service is rendered at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service.

Liabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the
benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the related service.

Liabilities recognised in respect of other long-term employee benefits such as annual leave and sick leave are measured
at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows expected to be made by the Group in respect of services
provided by employees up to the reporting date. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of
employment using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit retirement plans. Actuarial gains

and fosses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the
consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise. These obligations are valued annually by
independent qualified actuaries.

The obligations relating to compensated absences are presented as current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet
if the entity does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at feast twelve months after the reporting period,
regardless of when the actual settlement is expected to occur.

Critical accounting judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The Group provides both defined benefit employee retirement plans and defined contribution plans. Measurement of
pension and other superannuation costs and obligations under such plans require numerous assumptions and estimates
that can have a significant impact on the recognized costs and obligation, such as future salary level, discount rate,
attrition rate and mortality.

Multiemployer Plan

Certain union employees of Novelis Inc. in the United States are covered by a multi-employer plan based on
obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements. This plan provides retirement and other benefits to
participants generally based on their service to contributing employers. The benefits are paid from assets held
in trust for that purpose. Trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions and they are typically
responsible for oversight of the investment of the assets and administration of the plan.

Contribution rates and, in some instances, benefit levels are generally determined through the collective bargaining
process between the participating employers and unions. None of the Novelis Inc. collective bargaining agreements
require an increase in the Novelis’s total pension contributions to meet minimum funding requirements. All plans
that are defined benefit plans, on the basis of the terms of the benefits provided, are accounted for as defined
contribution plans because, among other things, there is insufficient information available to account for these plans
as defined benefit plans.

Compensated Absences

The Compensated absences cover the Group’s liability for earned leave and sick leave. The entire amount of the
provision of ¥ 683 Crore (31/03/2024: ¥ 593 Crore) is presented as current, since the Group does not have an
unconditional right to defer settlement for these obligations. Expected amount towards settlement of Leave for the
next 12 months are ¥ 52 Crore (31/03/2024: f 40 Crore).

Employee share-based payments

Equity settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of options at the grant date.

The fair value of options at the grant is expensed over the respective vesting period in which all of the specified
vesting conditions are to be satisfied with a corresponding increase in equity as “Employee Stock Options Account”.
In case of forfeiture of unvested option, portion of amount already expensed is reversed. Ina situation where the
vested options are forfeited or expires unexercised, the related balance standing to the credit of the “Employee
Stock Options Account’ are transferred to the “Retained Earnings”.

When the options are exercised, the Company issues new equity shares of the Company of 1/- each fully paid-
up. The proceeds received and the related balances standing to credit of the Employee Stock Options Account are
credited to share capital (nominal value) and Securities Premium Account.

Share appreciation rights which are cash settled, are recognised as employee benefit expense over the relevant
service period. The liability is fair valued at each reporting date and are presented as employee benefit obligations in
the consolidated balance sheet.

Employee Stock Option Scheme administered by any independent trust is deemed as the extended arm of the
Company and is consolidated in the financial statements. When the options are exercised, the trust transfers the
appropriate number of shares to the employee. The proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction
costs, are credited directly to equity.

The Group has formulated employee share-based payment schemes with objective to attract and retain talent and
align the interest of employees with the Group as well as to motivate them to contribute to its growth and profitability.
The Group views employee stock options as instruments that would enable the employees to share the value they
create for the Group in the years to come. At present four employee share-based payment schemes are in operation
at Hindatco Industries Limited, the Parent, whereas two employee share-based payment schemes are in operation
at Novelis inc., a subsidiary of the Company. Details of these employee share-based schemes are given below:

Employee share-based payments schemes at Novelis Inc (“Novelis”), a subsidiary of the Group:

The Novelis' Board of Directors has authorized long-term incentive plans, under which Hindalco stock appreciation
rights (‘Hindalco SAR’) and Hindalco restricted stock units (‘Hindalco RSU’) are granted to certain executive officers
and key employees.

The Hindalco SARs vest at the rate of 33% per year, subject to the achievement of an annual performance target.
During the year ended March 31, 2016 SARs expire in May of the seventh year from the original grant date, while
the during the year ended March 31, 2017 and onwards SARs expire seven years from their original grant date. The
performance criterion for vesting of the Hindalco SARs is based on the actual overall Novelis operating EBITDA
compared to the target established and approved each financial year. The minimum threshold for vesting each
year is 75% of each annual target operating EBITDA. Given that the performance criterion is based on an earnings
target in a future period for each financial year, the grant date of the awards for accounting purposes is generally not
established until the performance criterion has been defined.

Each Hindalco SAR is to be settled in cash based on the difference between the market value of one Hindalco
share on the date of grant and the market value on the date of exercise. The amount of cash paid to settle Hindalco
SARs is limited to three times the target payout, depending on the plan year. The Hindalco SARs do not transfer any
shareholder rights in Hindalco or Novelis to a participant. The Hindalco SARs are classified as liability awards and
are remeasured at fair value each reporting period until the SARs are settled.

The RSUs are based on Hindalco’s stock price. The RSUs vest either in full three years from the grant date or 33%
per year over three years, subject to continued employment with the Novelis, but are not subject to performance
criteria. Each RSU is to be settled in cash equal to the market value of one Hindalco share. The payout on the RSUs
is limited to three times the market value of one Hindalco share measured on the original date of grant. The RSUs
are classified as liability awards and expensed over the requisite service period (three years) based on the Hindalco
stock price as of each balance sheet date.

Contract liabilities

Contract liability is recognised when a payment is received from the customer before the Group transfers goods or
services to the customer.

As these are contracts that the Group expects, and has the ability, to fulfil through delivery of a non-financial item,
these are presented as advance from customers and are recognised as revenue as and when control of respective
commodities is transferred or service is provided to the customers under the agreements.

Other non-current and current liabilities

Liabilities that do not met the criteria of classifying as financial liabilities, not reported in any other categories separately
but are relevant to understand Group’s financial position are classified as other liabilities.

The details of other financial liabilities are given below:

(a) Customer refund liability are recognised mainly for discount payable to customers.
(b) Mainly includes payable towards the Indirect taxes such as Goods and Service Tax and withholding taxes etc.

(c) Deferred income mainly consist of below Government Grants, Refer Note 28 for further details.

17. Revenue from operations

The Group derives revenue principally from sale of hydrate, speciality alumina, aluminium and aluminium value added
products, di-ammonium phosphate, copper, precious metals (gold and silver) and other materials.

The Group recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation in accordance with the contract with the
customer. This is achieved when control of the product has been transferred to the customer, which is generally
determined when legal title, physical possession, risk of obsolescence, loss and rewards of ownership pass to the
customer and the Group has the present right to payment, ail of which occurs at a point in time upon shipment or delivery
of the product. in case of export of goods the Group considers shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfil the
promise to transfer the related products and the customer payments for shipping and handling costs are recorded as a
component of revenue.

in situations where revenue is recognized on shipment of goods, shipping and handling services are treated as a distinct
separate performance obligation and the Group recognises revenue for such services when the performance obligation is
completed and same are presented under the sale of services.

The Group considers the terms of the contract in determining the transaction price. The transaction price is based
upon the amount the Group expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring of promised goods and services to the
customer after deducting incentive programs, including but not limited to discounts, volume rebates etc. Transaction
price excludes taxes and duties collected on behalf of the government.

No element of significant financing is deemed present as the sales are made with a credit term, which is consistent
with market practice. The Group's obligation to repair or replace faulty products under the standard warranty terms is
recognised as a cost with a corresponding provision.

For certain customer contracts, final prices are determined based on the underlying market index of commodity prices at
a future date, for example prices on the London Metal Exchange Limited (LME) or London Bullion Markets Association
(LBMA). In such contracts, the Group records revenue on a provisional basis considering current market price when
control is transferred to the customer. At the end of each period, prior to final settlement date, adjustments are made to
the provisional sale price based on movements in the underlying market index of commodity prices up to the date of final
price determination. Such variable price movement is accounted as other operating revenue.

Revenue from irrevocable bill and hold/ holding certificate contracts is recognised when it is probable that delivery will be
made, goods have been identified and kept separately, are ready for delivery in the present condition and the Company
does not have the ability to use the product or to direct it to another customer. Under these arrangements, revenue is
recognised once legal! title has passed and control of the asset sold is transferred to the customer.

Export incentives and subsidies are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the
conditions and the incentive will be received.

Revenue excludes any taxes and duties collected on behalf of the government.

estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount on initial

recognition.

27. Earnings per share (EPS)

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to the equity shareholders of
the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average
number of equity shares outstanding during the period and for all periods presented is adjusted for events, such as bonus
shares, other than the conversion of potential equity shares that have changed the number of equity shares outstanding,
without a corresponding change in resources. Partly paid-up shares are included as fully paid equivalents according to
the fraction paid-up.

Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account
the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential equity shares and the
weighted average number of additional equity shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of alf
dilutive potential equity shares.

Treasury shares are excluded from weighted average numbers of equity shares used as a denominator in the calculation
of basic as well as diluted earnings per share.

Government Grants

Government grants are recognized at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the
conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.

Government grants whose primary condition is that the Group should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire
Non-Current assets are recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet by setting up the grant as deferred income. Grants
arising on acquisition of non-current assets are accounted as deferred income and amortisation is recognised in

‘Other income’ on straight line basis over the expected useful lives of related assets.

Other government grants (grants related to income) are recognized as income over the periods necessary to match them
with the costs for which they are intended to compensate, on a systematic basis. Government grants that are receivable
as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of providing immediate financial support
with no future related costs are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they
become receivable.

Grants related to income are presented under Other income or Other Operating Revenue in the consolidated statement
of profit and loss depending upon the nature of the underlying grant, except for grants received in the form of rebate or
exemptions related to expenditures, which are deducted in reporting the related expense.

The Group is eligible for various Government grants such as Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG), Manufacture and
other Operations in Warehouse Regulations (MOOWR) Scheme, Advance Authorisation (AA) scheme, Carbon Emission
Credit, etc.

Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG)

Under the EPCG scheme, the Group imports capital goods without payment of customs duty and in return the group
is required to fulfil export obligation within certain years equivalent to certain times of duty that has been saved

while importing. Grants are recognised in “Capital Work in Progress/Non-Current Asset” (PPE) at fair value with the
corresponding recognition under deferred income.

Manufacture and other Operations in Warehouse Regulations (MOOWR) Scheme

Under the MOOWR Scheme, the Group conducts manufacturing or other operations in a Customs bonded warehouse
and imports goods under customs duty deferment. The deferment stands without any time limitation. Grants are
recognised in “Capital Work in Progress/Non-Current Asset” (PPE) at fair value with the corresponding recognition under
deferred income.

Advance Authorisation

Advance Authorization licenses are issued against import of inputs which are used in manufacturing of an export product
and there is obligation to export the finished goods. Thus, we account it in nature of “income” as “Revenue Approach”.
Grants are recognised in inventory at the fair value of granti.e., the duty saved.

Carbon Emission Credit

The Group recognises carbon emission credit allotments for certain operations in Europe, UK and Asia, and income
associated with fixed asset investments in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. There are no unfulfilled
conditions or other contingencies attached to these grants.

Emission allowances are initially recognised as an intangible asset measured at fair value when the Group is granted the
allowances and able to exercise control with a corresponding recognition of a grant at the same amount under deferred
income. Liability related to Carbon Emission allowances is recognised based on actual emission. The provision is
measured at the carrying amount of allowances to the extent that the provision will be settled using allowances on hand
with any excess emission being measured at the market value of the allowances at the period end. The group records the
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss under other expenses.

Emission allowances are not amortised as their carrying value equals their residual value and therefore the depreciable
basis zero, as their value is constant until delivery to the authorities. Emission allowances are subject to impairment test.

When the emission allowances for the carbon dioxide emitted are delivered to the authorities, the intangible asset as
well as the corresponding provision are de-recognized from the consolidated balance sheet without any effect on the
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

Carbon emission credits are recognised at fair value upon receipt of government grants for operations in Europe and
Asia, which becomes their cost basis. These credits are utilised on a systematic basis over the applicable grant life
(Annual basis for Asia and over the seven year period for Europe).

Other Miscellaneous grants

Other Export incentive includes RODTEP scheme on Export, Duty Drawback on Export, ES Certificate and others. These
are directly accounted under “Revenue”.

Refer Note 3F - Intangible assets for Balance sheet movement of Carbon emission.

Refer Note 16 - Other liabilities for the details of Capital grant outstanding as “Deferred Income”.

Refer Note 17 for the details of export related Incentives and other benefits recognised under “Other Operating Revenues’.

31. Contingent liabilities and commitments
Contingent liabilities and assets

A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from a past event, with the resolution of the contingency
dependent on uncertain future events, or a present obligation where no outflow is probable. Material contingent
liabilities are disclosed in the consolidated financial statements unless the possibility of an outflow of economic
resources is remote. Contingent assets are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements unless it is virtually
certain that the future event will confirm the asset’s existence and the asset will be realised.

{A) Contingent liabilities

The Group is party to, and may in the future be involved in, or subject to, disputes, claims and proceedings arising
in the ordinary course of business, including some we assert against others, such as environmental, health and
safety, product liability, employee, tax, personal injury and other matters. The Group has established a liability
with respect to contingencies for which a loss is probable and estimable. While the ultimate resolution of and
liability and costs related to these matters cannot be determined with certainty, the Management does not believe
any of these pending actions, individually or in the aggregate, will materially impact our operations or materially
affect our financial condition or liquidity. The Group’s estimates involve significant judgment, and therefore, the
estimate will change from time to time and actual losses may differ from the current estimate

Management reviews the status of, and estimated liability related to, pending claims and civil actions ona
quarterly. The evaluation model includes all asserted and unasserted claims that can be reasonably identified
including claims relating to our responsibility for compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and
regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Group operate or formerly operated. The estimated costs in respect
of such reported liabilities are not offset by amounts related to insurance or indemnification arrangements unless
otherwise noted.

Critical accounting judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty

There are various legal, direct and indirect tax matters and other obligations including environmental, mining,
local and state levies, income tax holiday, availing input tax credits etc., which may impact the Group. Evaluation
of uncertain liabilities and contingent liabilities and assets arising out of the above matters require management
judgment and assumptions, regarding the probability of outflow or realization of economic resources and the
timing and amount, or range of amounts, that may ultimately be determined. Such estimates may vary from

the ultimate outcome as a result of differing interpretations of laws and facts, or application of relevant judicial
precedents.

The amount for which the Group is contingently liable are given below:

(% Crore)
As at
31/03/2024
{a) Claims against the Group not acknowledged as debt
Direct taxes matters - (i} 3 3
Indirect taxes matters - (ii) 883 912
Legal and other matters - (iii) 512 288

(i) Direct taxes matters: The Group has ongoing disputes with direct tax authorities in various tax jurisdictions
relating to tax treatment of certain items in the Company and some of its subsidiaries. These mainly include
claims disallowed, tax treatment of certain items of income/expense, use of certain tax incentives or
allowances, etc. in their tax computation.

(ii) Indirect taxes matters: There are pending litigations for various matters relating to customs, excise duty
and service tax, VAT etc. at across various entities in the Group involving demands, including interest and
penalties.

(iii) |Legal and other matters: In addition to above matters certain Group companies are involved in several other
legal claims including revenue matters, environmental matters, civil and Labour matters.

It is not practicable for the Group to estimate the timing of cash outflows, if any, in respect of the above matters,

pending resolution of the respective proceedings.

{b) Basis allegations, inter alia, of misutilization of coal mined in a mine deallocated in 2014-15, a chargesheet was
filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). On April 09, 2025, the Hon’ble Special Judge (Prevention of
Corruption Act) issued summons to the Company. CBI was directed to provide a complete copy of chargesheet
with all relied upon documents. Detailed review of the voluminous documents received on May 06, 2025
is currently underway. At present, we are not aware of any judicial determinations or claims under the said
proceedings which can have a quantifiable or material financial implication on the Company. The Company
continues to monitor all relevant developments in the matter with appropriate diligence and affirms that it will revisit
its disclosure obligations should any judicial finding, reading of the chargesheet, interim directive, penalty, or
adverse order arise in due course that could reasonably be construed as material under applicable regulations.

{c) White Rock USA Protected Cell 24, which is a legally segregated and constitute the sole source of settlement
for the related insurance obligations. The Protected Cell holds a reinsurance contract. Under the terms of the
arrangement, the Protected Cell is liable for certain percentage of claims, underlying the insurance coverage
program fronted by Zurich Insurance (“Zurich”).

The reinsurance agreement is integrally linked to the underlying insurance coverage and is considered a combined
contract, given the economic interdependence between the contracts. The reinsurance arrangement does not
alter the primary risk transfer to Zurich, which remains the principal insurer. In line with the contractual terms, the
Group has determined that the reinsurance liability arises only upon Zurich's approval of claims.

Claims amounting to = 214 Crore ($25 million) relate to potential liability payable by Novelis to Zurich upon
additional claim processed on account of Sierre flood, presented in the table above in Legal and other matters.

It is not practicable for the Group to estimate the timing of cash outflows, if any, in respect of the above matters, pending

resolution of the respective proceedings.

(b) Other Commitment for purchase of goods and Services (Net of Advance) 94,009 82,865

(c) During the previous year, the Company has entered into an agreement to invest in Ayana Renewable Power
Four Private Limited (ARPFPL), a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). ARPFPL will set up a solar plant and a wind
power plant having an installed capacity of 188 MW and 146 MW, respectively which will cater to 100 MW power
requirement of one of the smelters of the Company. The Company will subscribe for 26% equity shares in the
SPV. During the year, the Company has subscribed to its equity shares amounting to ¥ 11 Crore (Year ended
31/03/2024 : € 8 Crore) and is committed to finance a total of 150 Crore (Year ended 31/03/2024 : ¥ 161 Crore)
towards capital investment in the form of debt and equity, as per the arrangement and expected project expense.

32. Capital management

The Group's objective to manage its capital is to ensure continuity of business while at the same time provide
reasonable returns to its various stakeholders but keep associated costs under control. In order to achieve this,
requirement of capital is reviewed periodically with reference to operating and business plans that take into account
capital expenditure and strategic investments. Apart from internal accrual, sourcing of capital is done through judicious
combination of equity and borrowing, both short term and long term. Net debt (total borrowings + lease liabilities) to
equity ratio is used to monitor capital. No changes were made to the objectives, policies or processes for managing
capital during the year ended 31/03/2025 and 31/03/2024.

33. Fair value measurements of financial instrument

Critical accounting judgement

The Group applies valuation techniques to determine the fair value of financial instruments (where active market
quotes are not available). This involves developing estimates and assumptions consistent with the market participants
to price the instrument. The Group's assumptions are based on observable data as far as possible, otherwise on the
best information available. Estimated fair values may vary from the actual prices that would be achieved in an arm's
length transaction at the reporting date.

Level 1: Hierarchy includes financial instruments valued using quoted market prices. Listed equity instruments and
traded debt instruments which are traded in the stock exchanges are valued using the closing price at the reporting
date. Mutual funds are valued using the closing NAV.

Level 2: Hierarchy includes financial instruments that are not traded in active market. This includes over the counter
(OTC) derivatives, close ended mutual funds and debt instruments valued including quoted using observable market
data such as yield etc. of similar instruments traded in active market. Investment in Preference shares are valued using
discounted cash flow approach and all derivatives are reported at discounted values hence are included in Level 2.
Borrowings have been fair valued using credit adjusted interest rate prevailing on the reporting date. Trade Receivables
and Payables that are realigned based on forward LME/LBMA price movements have been included in Level 2
hierarchy.

Level 3: If one or more significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
This is the case for unlisted equity instruments and certain debt instruments including quoted which are valued using
assumptions from market participants.

Transfers from level 1 and 2 to level 3 and out of level 3 for unquoted debt instruments is based on unavailability/availability of
market observable inputs as on the reporting date. The Group’s policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of fair
value hierarchy levels as at the end of the reporting period.

Valuation process

Some of the Group’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for financial reporting purposes. The Management
of the Group has set up a team in the finance department which performs the valuation of financial assets and liabilities.

In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market-observable data to the extent it is available.
Where Level 1 inputs are not available, the Group engages third party qualified valuers to perform the valuation. The
team works closely with qualified external valuers to establish the appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the
model. The team reports findings to the Management of the Group to explain the cause of fluctuations in the fair value
of the assets and liabilities.

Valuation techniques used for valuation of instruments that are categorised as level 3.

For valuation of investments in equity shares that are unquoted, peer comparison has been performed, wherever
available. Valuation has been primarily done by considering the net worth of the company and price to book multiple to

arrive at the fair value. In cases where the income approach was feasible, valuation has been arrived using the earnings
capitalisation method or discounted cashflow method. For inputs that are not observable for these instruments, certain
assumptions are made based on available information. The most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate
and credit spreads used in the valuation process.

For valuation of investments in debt securities categorised as level 3, market polls which represent indicative yields are
used as assumptions by market participants when pricing the asset.

There were no significant inter-relationships between unobservable inputs that materially affect fair values.

Financial risk management
Refer Note 5D for accounting policies of Derivative and hedge accounting.

The Group's activities exposes it to various risks such as market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. This section explains
the risks which the Group is exposed to and how it manages the risks.

(a) Market risk

(i)

Commodity price risk

Hindalco’s India Operations consists of two businesses —- Copper and Aluminium. The Copper Business works
under a “Custom Smelting” model wherein the focus is to improve the processing margin. The timing mismatch
risk between the input and output price, which is linked to the same international pricing benchmark, is eliminated
through use of derivatives. This off-set hedge model (through use of derivatives) is used to manage the timing
mismatch risk for both commodities (Copper and Precious Metals) and Currency Risk (primarily, USD/INR). The
Copper Business also has a portion of view based exposure for both Commodity and Currency, beyond the above
timing mismatch risk. Lower copper prices, stronger USD/INR exchange rate and higher “Other Input” Prices (eg.
Coal, furnace oil, natural gas etc) are the major price risks that adversely impact the business. Here, the Group
may use derivative instruments, wherever available, to manage these pricing risks. A variety of factors, including
the risk appetite of the business and price view, are considered while taking hedging decisions. Such view based
hedges are usually done for the next 1-12 quarters.

The Aluminium Business is a vertically integrated business model wherein the input and output pricing risks are
independent of each other, i.e. - are on different pricing benchmarks, if any. Here, the Group may use derivative
instruments, wherever available, to manage its pricing risks for both input and output products. Lower aluminium
prices, weaker USD/INR exchange rate and higher Input Prices (e.g. Alumina, Furnace Oil, Coal, Electricity,
Natural Gas, Diesel Fuel) are the major price risks that adversely impact the business. Hedging decisions are
based on a variety of factors, including the risk appetite of the business and price view. Such hedge decisions are
usually done for the next 1-12 quarters.

Embedded derivatives (ED)

Copper concentrate is purchased on future pricing model based on month's average LME (in case of copper)

/ LBMA (in case of gold and silver). Since, the value of the concentrate changes in response to change in
commodity pricing indices, embedded derivatives (ED) are identified and segregated in the contract. The ED so
segregated, is treated like acommodity derivative and it qualifies for hedge accounting. These derivatives are put
into a Fair Value hedge relationship with respect to inventory.

Novelis business model is conducted under a conversion madel which allows it to pass through increases or
decreases in the price of aluminium to its customers. Derivative instruments are used to preserve conversion
margins and manage timing differences associated with metal price lag related to base aluminium price. Novelis
also uses several sources of energy such as natural gas, electricity, fuel oil and transport oil in manufacturing and
delivery of its products.

Decrease in prices in all the above mentioned commodities, other than Aluminium Options, by 10% will have an equal
and opposite impact in the financial statements. Sensitivity analysis has been computed by stress testing the market
price of the underlying price index on the outstanding derivative position as on the reporting date by assuming all other
factors constant.

Foreign currency risk

Exchange rate movements, particularly the United States Dollar (USD) and Euro (EUR) against Indian Rupee (INR)
and Euro, the Swiss franc, the Brazilian real and the Korean won against the U.S. dollar have an impact on our operating
results.

In India, in addition to the foreign exchange inflow from exports, the commodity prices in the domestic market are
derived based on the landed cost of imports where the LME prices and USD/INR exchange rate are the main factors.

In case of conversion business, the objective is to match the exchange rate of outflows and related inflows through
derivative financial instruments. With respect to the Aluminium business where costs are predominantly in INR, the
strengthening of INR against USD adversely affects the profitability of the business and benefits when INR depreciates
against USD. The Group enters into various foreign exchange contracts to protect profitability. The Group also enters
into various foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the risk arising out of foreign currency exchange rate movement in
foreign currency contracts executed with foreign suppliers to procure capital items for its project activities.

In Europe, where the Group has predominantly local currency selling prices and operating costs, it benefits as the Euro
strengthens, but is adversely affected as the Euro weakens. For Swiss operations, where operating costs are incurred
primarily in the Swiss franc and a large portion of revenues are denominated in the Euro, the Group benefits as the franc
weakens but is adversely affected as the franc strengthens. In South Korea, for local currency operating costs and

U.S. dollar denominated selling prices for exports, the Group benefits as the Korean won weakens but are adversely
affected as the Korean won strengthens. In Brazil, where the Group has predominately U.S. dollar selling prices and
local currency manufacturing costs, it benefits as the Brazilian real weakens, but is adversely affected as the Brazilian
real strengthens.

Interest rate risk

The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on financial liabilities such as borrowings, both short-term and long-
term. It maintains a balance of fixed and floating interest rate borrowings and the proportion is determined by
current market interest rates, projected debt servicing capability and view on future interest rates. Such interest
rate risk is actively evaluated and interest rate swap is taken whenever considered necessary.

The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk on its financial assets that include fixed deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial paper, mutual funds and liquid investments comprising mainly mutual funds (which are
part of cash and cash equivalents). Since, all these are generally for short durations, the Group believes it has
manageable and limited interest rate risk.

Liquidity risk
The Group determines its liquidity requirements in the short, medium and long term. This is done by drawing up
cash forecast for short and medium term requirements and strategic financing plans for long term needs.

The Group manages its liquidity risk ina manner so as to meet its normal financial obligations without any
significant delay or stress. Such risk is managed through ensuring operational cash flow while at the same time
maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalent position. The management has arranged for diversified funding
sources and adopted a policy of managing assets with liquidity in mind and monitoring future cash flows and
liquidity on a regular basis. Surplus funds not immediately required are invested in certain investments (including
mutual fund) which provide flexibility to liquidate at short notice and are included in current investments and cash
and cash equivalents. Besides, it generally has certain undrawn credit facilities which can be accessed as and
when required; such credit facilities are reviewed periodically.

The Group has developed appropriate internal control systems and contingency plans for managing its liquidity
risk. This incorporates an assessment of expected cash flows and the availability of alternative sources for
additional funding, if required.

Financing arrangement
The Group had access to the following undrawn borrowing facilities at the end of the reporting period:

The table below shows the Group's financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on their contractual
maturities for all non-derivative financial liabilities and net settled derivative financial instruments. The amounts
disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due within 12 months equal their
carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 608 — 609


When we read the integrated annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required
to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate action as applicable under the
relevant laws and regulations.

Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the
financial statements

7.

The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the
preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial
performance, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally
accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of the Act. The respective
Board of Directors of the Company, its joint operations and trustees of the trusts are responsible for the maintenance
of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the
Company, its joint operations and trusts and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and
application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of
the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the standalone financial statements by the Directors of
the Company, as aforesaid.

In preparing the standalone financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the Company, its joint operations
and trustees of the trusts are responsible for assessing the ability of the Company, its joint operations and trusts to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors of the Companies / trustees of the trusts either intends to
liquidate the Company, its joint operations and trusts, or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The respective Board of Directors of the Company, its joint operations and trustees of the trusts are also responsible for
overseeing the financial reporting process of the Company, its joint operations and trusts.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

10.

11.

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole

are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes

our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism
throughout the audit. We also:

. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3){i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our
opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial
statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
related disclosures made by management.

. Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast
significant doubt on the ability of the Company, its joint operations and trusts to continue as a going concern.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the
related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However,
future events or conditions may cause the Company, its joint operations and trusts to cease to continue as a
going concern.

. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in
amanner that achieves fair presentation.

. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial statements of the joint operations and trusts
which are included in the Company's financial statements to express an opinion on the standalone financial
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial
statements of such joint operations and trusts included in the standalone financial statements of which we are the
independent auditors. For the other joint operations and trusts included in the standalone financial statements,
which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision
and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

12. Wecommunicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing
of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during
our audit.

13. Wealso provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

14. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit
matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about
the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our
report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest
benefits of such communication.

Other Matter

15. We did not audit the standalone financial statements of two joint operations included in the standalone financial
statements of the Company, which constitute total assets of Rs. 13 crores and net assets of Rs. 13 crores as at March
31, 2025, total revenue of Rs. Nil, total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income)
of Rs. * crore and net cash in flows amounting to Rs. * crore for the year then ended. These financial statements
and other financial information have been audited by other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us by
the management, and our opinion on the standalone financial statements in so far as it relates to the amounts and
disclosures included in respect of these joint operations and our report in terms of sub section (3) of Section 143 of
the Act including report on Other Information in so far as it relates to the aforesaid joint operations, is based on the
reports of such other auditors and procedures performed by us. In respect of one joint operation, an emphasis of matter
paragraph with regard to going concern and in respect of one joint operation, a material uncertainty related to going
concern paragraph have been reported by the other auditors of the respective joint operations vide their audit report
which is not considered to be material to the standalone financial statements of the Company.

The standalone financial statements of two trusts included in the standalone financial statements of the Company,
which constitute total assets of Rs. 489 crores and net assets of Rs. 42 crores as at March 31, 2025, total revenue of
Rs. Nil, total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income) of Rs. 8 crores and net
cash out flows amounting to Rs. 9 crores for the year then ended, have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles applicable to trusts in India. The Company's management has converted the financial
statements of such trusts from the accounting principles generally accepted in India to Accounting Standards specified
under Section 133 of the Act. We have audited these conversion adjustments made by the Company's management.
Our opinion in so far as it relates to the balances and affairs of such trusts, is based on the report of other auditors and
the conversion adjustments prepared by the management of the Company and audited by us.

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements and our report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements below,
is not modified in respect of the above matters of our reliance on the work done and reports of the other auditors.

opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls system with reference to financial statements.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial statements

6. ACompany’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company's internal financial
controls with reference to financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the

Hindalco Industries Limited

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 614 — 615

maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of

the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors

of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial
statements

7.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud

may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial
statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion

8.

In our opinion, the Company and its joint operations, has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls
system with reference to financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to financial statements
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria
established by the Company and its joint operations considering the essential components of internal control stated in
the Guidance Note issued by ICAI.

Other Matter

9.

Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal
financial controls with reference to financial statements insofar as it relates to two joint operations, is based on the
corresponding reports of the auditors of such joint operations of the Company. Our opinion is not modified in respect of
this matter.

Annexure B to Independent Auditor’s Report

Referred to in paragraph 17 of the Independent Auditor's Report of even date to the members of Hindalco Industries Limited
onthe standalone financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2025

In terms of the information and explanations sought by us and furnished by the Company, and the books of account and
records examined by us during the course of our audit, and to the best of our knowledge and belief, we report that:

i)

(A) The Company is maintaining proper records showing full particulars, including quantitative details and
situation, of Property, Plant and Equipment.

(B) The Company is maintaining proper records showing full particulars of Intangible Assets.

The Property, Plant and Equipment are physically verified by the Management according to a phased programme
designed to cover all the items over a period of three years which, in our opinion, is reasonable having regard to
the size of the Company and the nature of its assets. Pursuant to the programme, a portion of the Property, Plant
and Equipment has been physically verified by the Management during the year and no material discrepancies

have been noticed on such verification.

The title deeds of all the immovable properties (other than properties where the Company is the lessee and the
lease agreements are duly executed in favour of the lessee), as disclosed in Note 3A on ‘Property, Plant and
Equipment’, Note 3C ‘Right of Use Assets’, Note 3E on ‘Investment Properties’ and Note 9 on ‘Non-Current

The Company has not revalued its Property, Plant and Equipment (including Right of Use assets) or Intangible
Assets or both during the year Consequently, the question of our commenting on whether the revaluation is based
on the valuation by a Registered Valuer, or specifying the amount of change, if the change is 10% or more in the
aggregate of the net carrying value of each class of Property, Plant and Equipment (including Right of Use assets)
or Intangible Assets does not arise.

No proceedings have been initiated on or are pending against the Company for holding benami property under the
Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 (as amended in 2016) (formerly the Benami Transactions
(Prohibition) Act, 1988 (45 of 1988)) and Rules made thereunder, and therefore the question of our commenting
on whether the Company has appropriately disclosed the details in the standalone financial statements does not
arise.

)

The physical verification of inventory excluding stocks with third parties has been conducted at reasonable
intervals by the Management during the year and, in our opinion, the coverage and procedure of such verification
by Management is appropriate. In respect of inventory lying with third parties, these have substantially been
confirmed by them. The discrepancies noticed on physical verification of inventory as compared to book records
were not 10% or more in aggregate for each class of inventory.

During the year, the Company has been sanctioned working capital limits in excess of Rs. 5 crores, in aggregate,
from banks on the basis of security of current assets. The Company has filed quarterly returns or statements with
such banks, which are in agreement with the unaudited books of account.

The Company has filed provisional statement with the bank for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, with respect
to Company’s Aluminium division and the final statement will be submitted to the bank upon finalisation of the
audited financial statements. (Also, refer Note 38(c)({x) to the standalone financial statements).

During the year, the Company has made investments in 3 companies, 111 mutual fund schemes, 10 Commercial
papers, 15 Bonds/Debentures, granted unsecured loans to its 293 employees. The aggregate amount during the
year, and balance outstanding at the balance sheet date with respect to such loans to its employees are as per the
table given below:

Aggregate amount of loan granted / Balance outstanding as at balance sheet

Particulars provided during the year * date in respect of these cases”
(% Crore) {® Crore)
Employees 3 2

*excludes amount granted to Hindalco Employee Welfare Trust for administering share based awards to
employees of the Company. (Also, refer Note 5E and Note 30 to the standalone financial statements)

In respect of the aforesaid investments/ loans, the terms and conditions under which such loans were granted/
investments were made are not prejudicial to the Company’s interest.

In respect of the loans, the schedule of repayment of principal and payment of interest has been stipulated,
and the parties are repaying the principal amounts, as stipulated, and are also regular in payment of interest
as applicable.

In respect of the loans, there is no amount which is overdue for more than ninety days.

There were no loans which have fallen due during the year and were renewed/extended. Further, no fresh loans
were granted to same parties to settle the existing overdue loans.

The loans granted during the year, including to related parties had stipulated the scheduled repayment of principal
and payment of interest and the same were not repayable on demand.

In our opinion, the Company has complied with the provisions of Section 186 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”)
in respect of the loans and investments made. Further, The Company has not stood guarantee or provided security to
any parties covered under Section 186 of the Act. The Company has not granted any loans or made any investments
or provided any guarantees or security to the parties covered under Sections 185 of the Act. Therefore, the reporting
under clause 3{iv) of the Order to that extent are not applicable to the Company.

The Company has not accepted any deposits or amounts which are deemed to be deposits referred in Sections 73, 74,
75 and 76 of the Act and the Rules framed there under.

Pursuant to the rules made by the Central Government of India, the Company is required to maintain cost records as
specified under Section 148(1) of the Act in respect of its products. We have broadly reviewed the same and are of the
opinion that, prima facie, the prescribed accounts and records have been made and maintained. We have not, however,
made a detailed examination of the records with a view to determine whether they are accurate or complete.

(a) Inour opinion, the Company is generally regular in depositing undisputed statutory dues in respect of income tax,
profession tax and employees’ state insurance, though there has been a slight delay in a few cases, and is regular
in depositing undisputed statutory dues, including provident fund, sales tax, service tax, duty of customs, duty of
excise, value added tax, cess, goods and services tax, clean environment cess and other material statutory dues,
as applicable, with the appropriate authorities. Also, refer Note 14A(ii) to the standalone financial statements
regarding management’s assessment on certain matters relating to provident fund. However, there are no arrears
of statutory dues outstanding as at March 31, 2025, for a period of more than six months from the date they
became payable.

(b) There are no statutory dues of provident fund, profession tax, employees’ state insurance and cess as referred
to in sub-clause (a) which have not been deposited on account of any dispute. The particulars of other statutory
dues referred to in sub-clause (a) as at March 31, 2025 which have not been deposited on account of a dispute,

The Company has entered into transactions with related parties in compliance with the provisions of Sections 177 and
188 of the Act. The details of related party transactions have been disclosed in the standalone financial statements as
required under Indian Accounting Standard 24 “Related Party Disclosures” specified under Section 133 of the Act.

(a) In our opinion, the Company has an internal audit system commensurate with the size and nature of its business.

(b) Some of the Internal Audit reports of the Company are in progress and accordingly, we have considered the
Internal Audit reports completed and made available to us for the purpose of our audit.

In our opinion, the Company has not entered into any non-cash transactions with its directors or persons connected
with him. Accordingly, the reporting on compliance with the provisions of Section 192 of the Act under clause 3(xv) of
the Order is not applicable to the Company.

(a) The Company is not required to be registered under Section 45-1A of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.
Accordingly, the reporting under clause 3(xvi)(a) of the Order is not applicable to the Company.

(b) The Company has not conducted non-banking financial / housing finance activities during the year. Accordingly,
the reporting under clause 3({xvi)(b) of the Order is not applicable to the Company.

(c) The Company is not a Core Investment Company (CIC) as defined in the regulations made by the Reserve Bank of
India. Accordingly, the reporting under clause 3(xvi)(c) of the Order is not applicable to the Company.

(d) Based on the information and explanations provided by the management of the Company, the Group, as
defined in the Core Investment Company (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016 has five CICs as part of the Group.
We have not, however, separately evaluated whether the information provided by the management is accurate
and complete.

The Company has not incurred any cash losses in the financial year or in the immediately preceding financial year.

There has been no resignation of the statutory auditors during the year and accordingly the reporting under clause
3(xviii) of the Order is not applicable to the Company.

On the basis of the financial ratios (Also refer Note 37 to the standalone financial statements), ageing and expected
dates of realisation of financial assets and payment of financial liabilities, other information accompanying the
standalone financial statements, our knowledge of the Board of Directors and management plans and based on

our examination of the evidence supporting the assumptions, nothing has come to our attention, which causes us

to believe that any material uncertainty exists as on the date of the audit report that the Company is not capable of
meeting its liabilities existing at the date of balance sheet as and when they fall due within a period of one year from the
balance sheet date. We, however, state that this is not an assurance as to the future viability of the Company. We further
state that our reporting is based on the facts up to the date of the audit report and we neither give any guarantee nor any
assurance that all liabilities falling due within a period of one year from the balance sheet date will get discharged by the
Company as and when they fall due.

(a) Inrespect of other than ongoing projects, as at balance sheet date, the Company does not have any amount
remaining unspent under Section 135(5) of the Act. Accordingly, reporting under clause 3(xx)(a) of the Order is
not applicable to the Company.

(b) The Company has transferred the amount of Corporate Social Responsibility remaining unspent under sub-
section (5) of Section 135 of the Act pursuant to ongoing projects to a special account in compliance with
the provision of sub-section (6) of Section 135 of the Act. (Also, refer Note 38(a) to the standalone financial
statements).

Basis of Preparation and Accounting
Policy Information

The basis of preparation and the material accounting
policies have been applied consistently to all the
periods presented in the standalone financial
statements, except where newly issued accounting
standard are initially adopted or a revision to an existing
accounting standard requires change in accounting
policy hitherto in use.

Compliance of Ind AS

The standalone financial statements comply in all
material aspects with the Indian Accounting Standards
(‘Ind-AS”) as prescribed under section 133 of the
Companies Act 2013 (“the Act”), other relevant
provisions of the Act as notified under the Companies
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, (including
subsequent amendments) and other accounting
principles generally accepted in India.

. Basis of preparation

The standalone financial statements have been
prepared and presented on the going concern basis
using accrual basis of accounting and under the
historical cost convention except for following assets
and liabilities which are measured at fair value:

. Derivative financial instruments; see Note 5F for
accounting policy

. Certain financial assets and liabilities; see Note 5,
12,18 and 35 for accounting policy

. Assets held for sale; see Note 9 for accounting
policy

. Employee's defined benefit plan assets and
liabilities; see Note 14B(a) for accounting policy

. Liability for cash based share-based payments;
see 14B(b) for accounting policy

. Inventories those are designated in a fair
value hedge relationship; see Note 8A, 5F for
accounting policy

. Assets and liabilities designated as hedged
items in fair value hedges that would otherwise
be carried at amortised cost are adjusted to
record changes in the fair values attributable to

the risks that are being hedged in effective hedge
accounting; see Note 5F for accounting policy

In preparing the financial statements, transactions

in currencies other than the Company’s functional
currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at

the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. At the end of each reporting period,
monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-
monetary items are measured at historical cost.

Exchange differences on monetary items are
recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the
period in which they arise, except for:

. eligible exchange differences on foreign currency
borrowings relating to qualifying assets under
construction are included in the cost of those
assets when they are regarded as an adjustment
to interest costs; and

. exchange differences on transactions entered
into in order to hedge certain foreign currency
risks (see Note 5F for accounting policies).

Changes in the fair value of non-monetary equity
instruments irrevocably classified as fair value through
other comprehensive income includes gain or loss on
account of exchange differences.

The fair value of financial liabilities and financial assets
denominated in a foreign currency are translated at

the spot rate at the end of the reporting period. The
foreign exchange component forms part of its fair value
gain or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured

at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using
the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was
measured.

The Company has determined current and non-
current classification of its assets and liabilities in the
standalone financial statements as per the Company’s
normal operating cycle, and other criteria set out

in Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013. Based

on the nature of products and the time lag between

the acquisition of assets for processing and their
realisation in cash and cash equivalents, the Company
has ascertained its normal operating cycle as 12
months for the purpose of current and non-current
classification of its assets and liabilities.

amended/ notified certain accounting standards
(see below), and are effective for annual reporting

The Ministry of Corporate affairs vide notification
dated 07" May, 2025 notified Companies (Indian
Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules,
2025 which amended Ind AS 21, ‘The Effects

of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’. The
amendments are not expected to significantly
affect the current or future periods.

3A.Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment held for use in the
production or/and supply of goods or services, or for
administrative purposes are stated in the balance
sheet at cost, less any subsequent accumulated
depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment
losses except for freehold land (other than freehold
land used for mining) which is carried at historical cost.

The present value of obligatory decommissioning
cost related to assets are included in the initial cost
of such assets. Cost may also include effective
portion on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign
currency purchases of property, plant and equipment
transferred from hedge reserve as basis adjustment.

Subsequent expenditure on major maintenance or
repairs includes the cost of the replacement of parts
of assets and overhaul costs. Where an asset or

part of an asset is replaced and it is probable that
future economic benefits associated with the item

will be available to the Company, the expenditure

is capitalised and the carrying amount of the item
replaced is derecognised. Similarly, overhaul costs
associated with major maintenance which can be
measured reliably are capitalised and depreciated
over their useful lives where it is probable that future
economic benefits will be available and any remaining
carrying amounts of the cost of previous overhauls
are derecognised. All other costs are charged to profit
and loss during the reporting period in which they are
incurred.

The Company based on the technical assessment
made by the technical expert/ management estimate,
depreciates certain items of building, plant and
equipment’s over the estimated useful lives which are
different from the useful life prescribed in Schedule II to

the Companies Act, 2013. The management believes
that these estimated useful lives are realistic and
reflect fair approximation of the period over which the
assets are likely to be used.

The Company reviews the estimated residual values
and expected useful lives of assets at least annually.
in particular, the Company considers the impact of
the health, safety and environmental legisiation in its
assessment of expected useful lives and estimated
residual values. Furthermore, the Company considers
environment-related matters, including physical

and transition risks. Specifically, the Company
determines whether environment-related legisiation
and regulations might impact either the useful lives

or residual values. Depreciation is calculated ona
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
assets as follows:

items of Property, Plant and Equipment iid on
Freehold land Infinite *
Buildings 5-60
Plant and Machinery 6-40
Vehicles and Aircraft 8-20
Railway Wagons 15
Railway Sidings 15
Furniture and Fixtures 8-10
Office Equipment 3-6

a includes freehold land used for mining which is

depreciated over 8 - 30 years.
s Cost incurred subsequent to capitalisation, accounted

as a separate component, is depreciated over the
remaining useful life of the underlying asset.

The accounting policy on depreciation and impairment
of non-current assets are described in notes 3G and
3H, respectively.

(g) Refer Note 31B{a) for capital expenditures contracted but not incurred.

(h) Refer Note 40 for reclassification of previous year amounts in current year.

3C. Right of Use Assets

The Company assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of the contract. The Company
recognises a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all ease arrangements in which it is
the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of ow
value assets. For short term leases, the Company recognises the ease payments as other expenses on a straight-line
basis over the fease term, unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic
benefits from the leased assets are consumed. Contingent and variable rentals are recognized as expense in the
periods in which they are incurred.

The Right of Use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding tease liability, lease payments
made at or before the commencement day and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

For certain class of assets, the Company allocates lease or non-fease components on the basis of their relative stand-
alone prices while assessing a contract at its inception or on reassessment.

The Company tests Impairment of right-of-use asset and accounts for any identified impairment loss as per its
accounting policy on ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’.

Extension and termination options are included in many of the leases. In determining the lease term, the management
considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not
exercise a termination option.

When the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for the head fease and sublease as two separate contracts.
The sublease is classified as finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head
lease.

Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial
direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased
asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

When a contract includes lease and non-lease components, the Company applies ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers to allocate the consideration under the contract to each component.

The accounting policy on depreciation and impairment of non-current assets are described in note 3G and 3H,
respectively.

Lease Liabilities

The fease payments that are not paid at the commencement date are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the
lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Company, the lessee’s
incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds
necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar
terms, security and conditions.

To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Company uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest
rate adjusted for credit risk and makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, security etc.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the fease liability comprise:

. Fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments) payable during the lease term and under
reasonably certain extension options, less any lease incentives;

. Variable fease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the
commencement date;

. The amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;
. The exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and

. Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the
lease.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the
fease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance liability for each period.

The fease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability
(using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made.

The Company remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset)
to reflect any re-assessment, lease modification, or revised in-substance fixed lease payments.

Extention and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Company.
These are used to maximize operational flexibilitity in terms of managing the assets used in the Company’s operations.
The majority of extention and termination options held are excercisable only by the Company and not by the respective
Lessor.

Investment Properties

investment properties (held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both) are stated in the balance sheet at cost,
fess any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. Transfer to, or from,
investment property is done at the carrying amount of the property.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

3F. Other Intangible Assets and Intangible Assets under Development

intangible assets acquired separately
intangible assets acquired are reported at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.

Mineral Reserves, Resources and Rights (Mining Rights)

Mineral reserves, resources and rights (together referred to as ‘mining rights’) which can be reasonably valued, are
recognised in the assessment of fair values on acquisition. Mining rights also includes stripping cost.

Stripping cost

Stripping costs incurred during the mining production phase are allocated between cost of inventory produced

and the existing mine asset. The stripping ratio, as approved by the regulatory authority, for the life of the mine is
obtained by dividing the estimated quantity of overburden by the estimated quantity of mineable coal / bauxite reserve
to be extracted over the fife of the mine. This ratio is periodically reviewed and changes, if any, are accounted for
prospectively.

Stripping costs are allocated and included as a component of the mine asset when they represent significantly
improved access to ore, provided all the following conditions are met:

. itis probable that the future economic benefit associated with the stripping activity will be realised;
. the component of the ore body for which access has been improved can be identified; and
. the costs relating to the stripping activity associated with the improved access can be reliably measured.

The overburden removai costs are included in Mining Rights under intangible assets and amortised based on stripping
ratio on the quantity of coal / bauxite excavated.

The residual value and useful life of Intangible assets are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each
reporting period.

The Company has performed an assessment of its Intangible Assets for possible triggering events or circumstances
for an indication of impairment and has concluded that there were no triggering events or circumstances that would
indicate that the Intangible Assets are impaired.

The carrying value of gross assets as on 31/03/2025 includes % 48 Crore towards cost of Mining rights incurred at one

3G. Depreciation and Amortisation Expenses
Property, Plant & Equipment
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or value of assets, net off their residual values, over their estimated
useful lives. Depreciation is recorded using the straight line basis. The estimated useful lives and residual values
are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. Each
component of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of that
item is depreciated separately if its useful life differs from the other components of the asset.

Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use. Depreciated assets and accumulated
depreciation amounts are retained fully until they are removed/retired from active use.

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their useful fife or the lease term, unless the entity expects
to use the assets beyond the lease term.

The useful life of the items of Property, Plant and Equipment is based on the technical assessment by management for
the current and comparative period which is in line with the useful life precribed in Schedule ! of the Companies Act,
2013.

Right of Use assets

ROU assets are depreciated over the shorter period of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset using
the straight line basis. If the Company is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is
depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful life. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease.

changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.

Mining rights
Exploitable mineral rights are amortised using the unit of production basis over the commercially recoverable reserves.

Commercially recoverable reserves are proved and probable reserves. Mineral resources are included in amortisation
calculations where there is a high degree of confidence that they will be extracted in an economic manner.

Changes in the commercial recoverable reserves affecting unit of production calculations are dealt with prospectively
over the revised remaining reserves.

Impairment Loss/ (Reversal) on Non-Current Assets (Net)

Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually
for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. Non
current assets other than goodwill are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value
fess costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest
levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are fargely independent of the cash inflows from
other assets or groups of assets (cash- generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an
impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period.

Critical Accounting Judgment and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

The Company assesses conditions that could cause an asset or a Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to become impaired
and to test recoverability of potentially impaired assets. These conditions include changes resulting from market and
economic environment, including internal and external factors such as the Company’s market capitalization, significant
changes in the Company’s planned use of the assets or a significant adverse change in the expected prices, sales
volumes or raw material cost. The identification of CGUs involves judgment, including assessment of where active
markets exist, and the level of interdependency of cash inflows. CGU is usually the individual plant, unless the asset or
asset group is an integral part of a value chain where no independent prices for the intermediate products exist, a group
of plants is combined and managed to serve a common market, or where circumstances otherwise indicate significant
interdependencies.

Determination of the recoverable amount involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as
commodity prices and their impact on markets and prices for upgraded products, demand for products, inflation,
currency rate movements, input cost prices, operating expenses and tax and legal environment. The Company uses

7

internal business plans, quoted market prices and the Company's best estimate of commodity prices, currency rates,
discount rates and other relevant information. A detailed forecast is developed for a period of three to five years with
projections thereafter.

Goodwill

Goodwill arising on acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business
fess accumulated impairment losses, if any. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the
cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently
when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less
than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in
the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

value less cost to sell method” as at 31/03/2025 and no impairment has been identified.

Financial Assets

All financial assets are recognised on trade date when the purchase of a financial asset is under a contract whose term
requires delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned. Financial assets are
initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets which are classified as at fair
value through profit or loss (FVTPL) at inception. Alf recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their
entirety at either amortised cost or fair value.

Classification of financial assets

Financial assets are classified as ‘equity instrument’ if these are non-derivative and meets the definition of ‘equity’ for
the issuer. All other non-derivative financial assets are ‘debt instruments’.

Initial recognition and subsequent measurement
Financial assets at amortised cost

The Company measures debt instrument at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:

1) the asset is heid within a business model whose objective is to hold asset in order to collect contractual cash
flows; and

2) the contractual terms of the instrument give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Debt instruments meeting these criteria are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method less any impairment, with interest recognised on an effective yield basis in Other income.

Financial assets classified at amortised cost comprises of trade receivables, loans, deposits, matured derivatives
pending realisation, accrued interest and other receivables.

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
A) Equity instrument

At initial recognition, an irrevocable election is made (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate
investments in equity instruments (other than held for trading purpose) at FVTOCI.

An Investment is held for trading if:
1) it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling it in the near term; or

2) — oninitial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Company manages
together and has evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or

3) itis a derivative that is not designated in an effective hedge relationship as a hedging instrument or a financial
guarantee.

Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses
arising from changes in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the ‘Gain/
(Loss) on Equity instruments FVTOC!’. Where the asset is disposed of, the cumulative gain or loss previously
accumulated in the ‘Gain/ (Loss) on Equity Instruments FVTOCY is directly reclassified to retained earnings.

B) Debt instrument
Debt instrument are measured at FVTOCI if both of the following conditions are met:

1) Debt instrument is held within a business model whose objective is to hold asset in order to collect
contractual cash flows and selling assets; and

2) the contractual terms of the instrument give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Investment meeting these criteria are subsequently measured at fair value with any gains or losses arising on
re-measurement recognised in other comprehensive income, except for impairment gains or losses, interest
income and foreign exchange gains or losses which are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Interest
calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the statement of profit and loss as Other
income. When the debt instrument is derecognised the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other
comprehensive income is reclassified to the statement of profit and loss as a reclassification adjustment.

Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets that do not meet the criteria of classifying as amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive
income described above, or that meet the criteria but the entity has chosen to designate as at FVTPL at initial
recognition, are measured at FVTPL.

Investments in equity instruments are classified as at FVTPL, unless the Company designates an investment that is
not held for trading at FVTOC! at initial recognition. Financial assets at FVTPL are subsequently measured at fair value,
with any gains or losses arising on re-measurement recognised in the statement of profit and loss. interest income from
these investment is included in Other income.

impairment of financial assets

On initial recognition of the financial assets, a loss allowance for expected credit loss is recognised in the statement of
profit and loss for debt instruments carried at amortised cost and FVTOCI.

Expected credit losses of a financial instrument is measured in a way that reflects:
1) anunbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
2) _ the time value of money; and

3) reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about
past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

At each reporting date, the Company assesses whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased
significantly since initial recognition.

When making the assessment, the Company compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as

at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the date of initial recognition
and consider reasonable and supportable information, that is available without undue cost or effort, that is indicative of
significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition.

If, at the reporting date, the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition,
the Company measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month expected
credit losses. If, the credit risk on that financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the
Company measures the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit
losses.

The amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date is
recognised as an impairment loss or gain in the statement of profit and loss.

De-recognition of financial assets

The Company derecognises financial asset on trade date only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the
asset expire, or when it transfers the financial assets and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another
entity or when it retains contractual rights to retain contractual cash flows from asset, but assumes a contractual
obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipient. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially

all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the financial assets, the Company recognises its
retained interest in the financial assets and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Company
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Company continues to
recognise financial assets and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.

On de-recognition of a financial assets other than in its entirety (e.g. when the Company retains an option to repurchase
part of a transferred assets), the Company allocates the previous carrying amount of the financial assets between the
part it continues to recognise under continuing involvement, and the part it no longer recognises on the basis of the
relative fair values of those parts on the date of the transfer. The difference between the carrying amount allocated to
the part that is no longer recognised and the sum of the consideration received for the part no longer recognised and
any cumulative gain or loss allocated to it that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in
the statement of profit and loss. A cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is
allocated between the part that continues to be recognised and the part that is no longer recognised on the basis of the
relative fair values of those parts.

investment in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures

The investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are carried in the financial statements at historical cost except

when the investment, or a portion thereof, is classified as held for sale, in which case it is measured at lower of

carrying amount and fair value fess costs to sell. When the Company is committed to a sale plan involving disposal

of an investment, or a portion of an investment, in any subsidiary or joint venture, the investment or the portion of the
investment that will be disposed of is classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met. Any retained
portion of an investment in a subsidiary or a joint venture that has not been classified as held for sale continues to be
accounted for at historical cost.

Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures carried at cost are tested for impairment in accordance with ind AS 36

Impairment of Assets. The carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment as a single asset by comparing
its recoverable amount with its carrying amount, any impairment loss recognised reduces the carrying amount of the
investment.

investment in Associates

The investments in associates are carried in these financial statements at fair Value through Other Comprehensive
Income (FVTOCI).

Derivatives & Hedge Accounting

The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as forwards, futures, options etc. to hedge its risks associated
with foreign exchange fluctuation and price risk movements. Risks associated with fluctuation in the price of the
products (copper, aluminium, coal, furnace oil, natural gas, coal tar pitch and precious metals) are minimized by
undertaking appropriate derivative instruments.

The Company also identifies embedded derivatives in certain transactions. Derivatives embedded in other contracts
are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to their host contracts.
In some cases, the embedded derivatives may be designated in a hedge relationship. The fair values of all such
derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date. Embedded derivatives
closely related to the host contracts are not separated. Derivatives embedded in a host contract that is an asset within

the scope of ind AS 109 are not separated. Derivatives embedded in all other host contract are separated only if the
economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics
and risks of the host and are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets with embedded derivatives
are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.
These derivatives are designated into a hedge relationship if they meet hedge accounting criteria.

The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the residual maturity of the
derivative is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability when the residual maturity of the derivative is less
than 12 months as at the end of reporting period.

Fair value measurement of derivatives

Fair value of financial derivatives is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, calculated by reference to
quoted price curves and exchange rates as of the balance sheet date whereas options are valued using appropriate
option pricing models by the Company. For valuation of options, credit spreads are applied where deemed to be
significant.

Fair value measurement of embedded derivatives

The Company values embedded derivatives that are separated from the host contract by comparing the forward curve
at contract inception to the forward curve as of the balance sheet date. Changes in the present value of the cash flows
related to the embedded derivative are recognized in the Balance Sheet and in the statement of Profit and Loss.

The Company designates commodity hedges of Copper, Gold and Silver at the fair value of recognised assets (or
liabilities or a firm commitment) under fair value hedge. Currency hedges and Commodity hedges of Aluminium
business are designated based on a particular risk associated with the cash flow of recognised assets (or liabilities or a
highly probable forecast transaction) under cash flow hedge.

The Company also applies hedge accounting using certain foreign currency non-derivative monetary items which are
used as hedging instruments for hedging foreign exchange risk.

The Company documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged
items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The
Company also documents the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Company will assess whether the hedging
relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including its analysis of the sources of hedge ineffectiveness
and how it determines the hedge ratio).

Change in Fair value of derivatives that are not designated in any hedge relationship as mentioned above are
accounted through the Statement of Profit and Loss at each reporting date.

Fair value hedge

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the
statement of profit and loss, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that are attributable to the
hedged risk.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it
no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising
from the hedged risk is amortised to the statement of profit and loss from that date except for inventory that is charged
to statement of profit and loss on sale of goods.

Cash flow hedges

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges

is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading cash flow hedging reserve within
equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss,
and is included in the ‘(Gain) / Loss in Fair Value of Derivatives’ line item.

5H. Trade Receivables

Trade receivables are measured at their transaction price on initial recognition, unless it contains a significant financing
component or pricing adjustments embedded in the contract in which cases it is recognised at fair value. Trade
receivables which are held with the objective of collecting the contractual cash flows, are subsequently measured at
amortised cost less loss allowance.

Trade receivables which are subject to a factoring arrangement without recourse are de-recognized in its entirety.
Under this arrangement, the Company transfers relevant receivables to the factor in exchange for cash and does not
retain late payment and credit risk. Trade receivables subject to factoring arrangements are subsequently measured at
FVTOCI.

Trade receivables which arise from contracts where the sale price is provisional and revenue model have the character
of a commodity derivative are measured at fair value. The fair value is measured at forward rate and subsequent
changes are recognised as Other Operating Revenue.

For Trade Receivables and Contract Assets, the Company applies the simplified approach which requires expected life
time fosses to be recognized from initial recognition of the receivables.

The details of trade reveivables outstanding as at the reporting date are given below:

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits and short term highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and
are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.

The Company adopts a policy of managing assets with liquidity in mind and monitoring future cash flows and liquidity
on a regular basis. investments in overnight mutual funds are classified as cash and cash equivalents as the instrument
itself is readily convertible into cash and has a determinable market value. At the time of the initial investment, the
Company is satisfied that the risk of changes in value is insignificant and therefore the amount of cash to be received on
redemption is known. Such investments have lower risk of changes in fair value, provide flexibility to liquidate at short
notice, including during times of market stress.

Income taxes
income tax expense comprises of tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from ‘profit before tax’ as reported
in the statement of profit and loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years
and items that are never taxable or deductible. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.

Deferred tax on the deductible temporary difference and taxable temporary differences in respect of carrying value of
right of use assets and lease liability and their respective tax bases are recognised separately.

Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable
that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that at the time of
transaction affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that itis
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be avaifable to alfow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the
liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax
consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the reporting date, to recover or
setife the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off when they relate to
income taxes levied by the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the Company
has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the
liability simultaneously.

Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) is recognized as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence
that the Company will pay normal income tax during the specified period. in the year in which the MAT credit becomes
eligible to be recognized as an asset, the said asset is created by way of credit to the statement of profit and loss and
included in deferred tax assets. The Company reviews the same at each balance sheet date and writes down the
carrying amount of MAT entitlement to the extent there is no longer convincing evidence to the effect that Company will
pay normal income tax during the specified period.

Current and deferred tax for the period

Current and deferred tax are recognised in the statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises
from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business
combination.

Uncertain tax positions are reflected in the overall measurement of the Company's tax expense and are based on the
most likely amount or the expected value arrived at by the Company which provides a better prediction of the resolution
of uncertainty. Uncertain tax positions are monitored and updated as and when new information becomes available,
typically upon examination or action by the taxing authorities or through statute expiration and judicial precedent.

The Company considers when a particular amount payable for interest and penalties on income taxes is determined to
be within the scope of Ind AS 37, it is presented as part of financing cost or other expenses, respectively unless when
there is an overall settlement with tax authority and the interest and penalties cannot be identified separately in which
case it is determined to be part of income taxes and accounted under Ind AS 12 Income taxes.

Critical accounting judgment and key sources of estimation of taxes uncertainties and valuation
allowances

The Company calculates income tax expense based on reported income. Deferred income tax expense is calculated
based on the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and

their respective tax basis that are considered temporary in nature. Valuation of deferred tax assets is dependent on
management’s assessment of future recoverability of the deferred tax benefit. Expected recoverability may result from
expected taxable income in the future, planned transactions or planned tax optimizing measures. Economic conditions
may change and lead to a different conclusion regarding recoverability.

The Company is subject to tax assessments and ongoing proceedings, which are pending before various Tax Appellate
Authorities. Management periodically evaluates the positions taken in tax returns with respect to above matters,
including unresolved tax disputes, which involves interpretation of applicable tax regulations and judicial precedents.
Current tax liability and tax asset balances are presented, after recognising as appropriate, provision for taxes payable
and contingencies basis management's assessment of outcome of such ongoing proceedings and amounts that

may become payable to the tax authorities. Considering the nature of such estimates and uncertainties involved, the
amount of such provisions may change upon final resolution of the matters with tax authorities.

Includes an advance off 101 crore given to Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) who are constructing
acommon desalination plant (the ‘Plant’) at Dahej Industrial Area in Gujarat through a SPV, having total estimated cost
of 1,140 crore. The Group's participation is 10% of total capacity. Pending finalisation of the structure of the SPV, this
amount has been recorded under Capital Advance.

Prepaid Expenses includes = 45 Crore (as at 31/03/2024 & 70 Crore) towards surplus Plan Assets of Gratuity Fund
recognised, Refer Note 14B (a)(|)(a){ix) for further details.

Mainly includes claims receivables from Indirect Tax Authorities and other Government authorities.

Includes ¥ 192 Crore (Garepalma mines at Chattisgarh = 74 Crore and Kathautia mines in Jnarkhand = 118 Crore) [as
at 31/03/2024 € 192 Crore (Garepalma mines % 74 Crore and Kathautia mines € 118 Crore)] towards appropriation of
Performance Bank Guarantee by Nominated Authority (NA). Details are given below :

Gare Palma |V/4 (GP-4), Gare Palma IV/5 (GP-5) and Kathautia coal mines were acquired by the Company through
auction conducted by the Nominated Authority (NA) constituted under the Ministry of Coal, Government of India.

The Company was required to achieve certain efficiency parameters and reach their Peak Rated Capacity (PRC) during
FY 2015-16. Performance security in the form of Performance Bank Guarantees (PBG) of 318 crore (for GP-4),

& 369 crore (for GP-5) and % 267 crore (for Kathautia) were provided by the Company to NA in this regard.

Due to the various delays on the part of Government Authorities, PRC was achieved by the Company for GP-4 and
GP-5 during FY 2016-17 and for Kathautia during FY 2017-18. Having satisfied itself about achievement of efficiency
parameters/ PRC, NA returned the PBG in respect of GP-4 on 19/06/2017. However, in a volte face action, vide a letter
dated 25/04/2018, NA imposed a penalty equal to 20% of PBG amounting to 7 64 Crore for GP-4, = 74 Crore for GP-5
and € 118 Crore for Kathautia. As the PBG for GP-5 is still with NA, it also appropriated an amount equal to the penalty
from the PBG of the GP-5 mines. For Kathautia Coal Mine only appropriated amount of 118 crore is with NA. In terms
of agreement, we have not renewed the PBG for the remaining amount.

The above actions were contested by the Company. The Hon’ble Chhattisgarh High Court at Bilaspur has already
given its judgment in favour of the Company in the matter related to GP-5. As per the judgment, Hon'ble High Court

has asked NA to refund the amount appropriated by them and return the PBG to the Company. The NA had filed an
appeal before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The Hon‘ble Supreme Court, vide its order dated 23.04.2025, dismissed the
appeal and directed the NA to refund the appropriated amount within three months. The Company's appeal to quash
the demand raised by NA in case of GP-4 is yet to be decided and is pending before the Mines Tribunal at Bilaspur. In
case of Kathautia, the Company had preferred a petition before Mines Tribunal at Ranchi for quashing of appropriation
order and the Tribunal had ordered to refund = 118 Crore after holding that the appropriation order was bad. The NA has
challenged the Tribunal’s order by filing a writ petition before the Hon’able High Court of Jharkhand.

Refer Note 30 for balances with related parties.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of finished goods and work in progress
includes raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads. Costs of inventories include
the transfer from equity any gains/losses on qualifying cash flow hedges for purchases of raw materials.

Cost of raw material, coal and fuel and traded goods comprises of Cost of purchases and also include all other costs
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition and are net of rebates and discounts.

The inventories are measured at Fair Value only in those cases where the Inventories are designated into a fair value
hedge relationship.

{a)

(b)
(c)

(a)

Cost is determined using the weighted average cost basis. However, the same cost basis is applied to ail inventories of
a particular class. inventories of stores and spare parts are valued at weighted average cost basis after providing for
cost of obsolescence and other anticipated losses, wherever considered necessary.

Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and
costs necessary to make the sale.

Materials and other supplies held for use in the production of inventories (finished goods, work-in-progress) are not
written down below cost if the finished products in which they will be used are expected to sell at or above the cost.

Critical accounting judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty

Measurement of bulk inventory quantities (such as coal, bauxite, copper concentrates, etc.) lying at yards and work
in progress of precious metals at smelter and refinery is material, complex and involves significant judgement and
estimates resulting from measuring the surface area, dip measurement of materials in tanks/silos, ete. The Company
performs physical counts of the above inventory on a periodic basis using internal / external experts to perform
volumetric surveys and assessments, basis which the estimate of quantity for these inventories is determined.

The variations noted between book records and physical quantities of the above inventories are evaluated and
appropriately accounted in the books of accounts.

The details of inventories outstanding as at the reporting date are given below:

The Company has applied fair value hedge accounting on its Copper, Gold and Silver inventory which forms part of
Work-in-Progress and Finished Goods. Fair value hedges are mainly used to hedge the exposure to the change in fair
value of commodity price risks. The fair value adjustment remains part of the carrying value of inventory and is taken to
the statement of profit and loss when the inventory is either sold or consumed, Refer Note 5F(a) and 5F(h).

For Inventories hypothecated against secured short-term borrowings, Refer Note 12B.

Write downs of inventories (net of reversal) to net realizable value related to raw materials, work-in-progress and
finished goods amounted to ¥ 558 Crore (as at 31/03/2024 € 594 Crore). These were recognized as expense during the
year and included in ‘cost of material consumed’ and ‘change in value of inventories of Finished goods,
Work-in-Progress and Stock-in-Trade’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Inventories in hand includes bulk materials of Coal, Bauxite and Copper Concentrate lying in yards at plants, mines and
precious metals of Gold and Silver lying at Copper smelter and refinery aggregating to = 3,701 Crore (as at 31/03/2024

Non-Current Assets classified as Held for Sale

principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when
the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for
sales of such asset (or disposal group) and its sale is highly probable. Management must be committed to the sale,
which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.

Non-current assets classified as held for safe are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less
costs to sell except for those assets that are specifically exempt under relevant ind AS. Once the assets are classified
as “Held for sale”, those are not subjected to depreciation till disposal.

An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset to fair value fess costs to sell.

realised over and above par value upon issuance of equity shares are accounted for as ‘Securities Premium’ under
‘Other Equity’. incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new ordinary shares, share options and
buyback are recognized as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.

are recognised at cost and the par value of treasury shares is reduced from equity share capita! whereas the difference
between cost and par value is deducted from treasury shares held by ESOP trust under ‘Other Equity’. No gain or

foss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own
equity instruments. Consideration received on issue or sale is recognised directly in equity. Any difference between the
carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in Securities premium. Treasury shares are alloted

12. Financial Liabilities
Financial Liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at FVTPL or financial liabilities at amortised cost.

Financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL) when it is either held for trading or it is designated
as at FVTPL.It is classified as held for trading if:

1) ithas been acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing it in the near term; or

2) — oninitial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Company manages together and for
which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or

3) itis a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.
A financial liabilities other than those held for trading may also be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:

1) such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise
arise; or

2) _ it forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its performance is
evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Company’s documented risk management or investment strategy,
and information about the Company is provided internally on that basis; or

3) — it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and ind-AS 109 Financial Instruments permits
the entire combined contract to be designated as at FVTPL.

Financial Liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on re-measurement recognised in
the statement of profit and loss, except for the amount of change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable
to changes in the credit risk of that liability which is recognised in other comprehensive income. Other financial liabilities,
including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.

De-recognition of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an
existing fianncial liabilities are replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original
liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement
of profit or loss.

(b) Refer Note 40 for reclassification of previous year amounts in current year.

12D. Supplier's Credit

Supplier's credit represents the extended interest bearing credit offered by the supplier which is secured against Usance
Letter of Credit (LC). Under this arrangement, the supplier is eligible to receive payment from negotiating bank prior to the
expiry of the extended credit period. The interest for the extended credit period payable to the bank on maturity of the LC has
been presented under Finance Cost.

Critical accounting judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The Company participates in various supply chain finance programs under which participating suppliers may voluntarily
elect to self some or all of their Company receivables to third-party financial institutions. Supplier participation in the
programs is solely up to the supplier, and participating suppliers enter their arrangements directly with the financial
institutions. The Company derecognises financial liability when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled
or expires. A significant amount of management judgement is involved in such arrangements to determine when an existing
financial liability is replaced by another on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a
new liability.

one or more embedded derivatives, and eligible for designation in its entirity as per ind-AS 109 Financial instruments, are
subsequently measured at FVTPL.

13. Provisions

Provisions are recognized when there is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is
probable (“more likely than not”) that it is required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount
of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation

at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is
measured using the estimated cash flows to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those
cash flows. The discount rate used is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money in
that jurisdiction and the risks specific to the fiability.

Provisions are reviewed at each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. In case the settlement
of obligations are no longer required, the provision are reversed.

value of money on the environmental liabilities is recognised in the statement of profit and loss as interest expense.

During the current year Provision made majorly includes provision against disposal of Phospho Gypsum & 88 Crore
(31/03/2024: ¥ 27 Crore) , Fly ash disposal % 4 Crore ( 31/03/2024: 45 Crore), disposal of spent pot lining = 4 Crore
(81/03/2024: F 37 Crore).

Enterprise Social Commitment

Enterprise Social Commitment is the amount to be spent on social and economic development of the surrounding
area over a period of time where any new project is set up. Such obligation arises out of conditions mentioned in
the Environment Clearance Certificate given by the Government for new projects and are generally defined as a
percentage of total project cost. Present value of such future cash flows discounted at appropriate and applicable
discount rates are capitalised against the obligation created. Actual cash flows that happen over the period are
adjusted against the obligation. The effect of time value of money on the provision is recognised in the statement
of profit and loss as interest expense. Enterprise Social Commitment also includes provision against Corporate
Environment Responsibility (CER).

The outflow of economic resources is expected over a period until Financial year 2056.

Renewable Power Obligation

Some units of the Company situated in various states like Odisha, Madhya Pradesh , Maharashtra ,Gujarat, Jharkhand
etc. who generate power from Captive power plants or procure power from open source, are obligated to purchase
certain portion of their power consumption from Renewable Energy sources, both solar and non-solar. This gives rise
to Renewable Power Obligation (RPO). In case the obligated units fail to procure power from such renewable sources,
they need to meet the obligation by purchasing Renewable Energy Certificates from authorised energy exchanges as
an alternative.

Renewable Power obligation is created to the extent any obligated unit is unable to source renewable energy as a
replacement to carbon energy as per requirement of the applicable regulation during the reporting period and is carried
in books till the obligation is discharged by purchasing Renewable Energy Certificate from any of the authorised
exchanges.

Legal Cases

The Company reviews the legal cases based on consideration of the information which becomes available up to

the date on which the financial statements are approved. The provisions relating to legal, tax and other matters are
recognised once it has been established that the Company has a present obligation since those events are probable
to happen i.e. more likely than not but timing of occurrence of such events is uncertain till settled at the highest Courts
of law. In some cases, the Company entail seeking expert advice in making the determination on whether there is a
present obligation.

Miscellaneous Provisions:

The Company discloses the provision which are not reported in any other categories seperately viz.statutory provisions
related to, indirect taxes, coal cess etc under this head. There are few other provisions which are evalauted on each
reporting date viz. Restructurings, Onerous contracts, Restoration (including Mine closure), rehabilitation and
decommissioning.

(i) | The Cade on Social Security, 2020 (‘Code’) relating to employee benefits during employment and post employment
benefits received Presidential assent in September 2020. The Code has been published in the Gazette of India.
However, the date on which the Cade will come into effect has not been notified. The Company will assess the impact of
the Code when it comes into effect and will record any related impact in the period the Code becomes effective.

(ii) The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (“SC”) by their order dated 28/02/2019, in the case of Surya Roshani Limited v/s
EPFO, set out the principles based on which allowances paid to the employees should be identified for inclusion in
basic wages for the purposes of computation of Provident Fund contribution. The Company has given effect of the
above judgement effective 01/03/2019. This does not have any material impact on the Financial Statements.

14B.Employee Benefit Obligations
Retirement benefits, medical plans and termination benefits

A defined contribution plan is a pension pian under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The
Company has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to
pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Payments to defined contribution
retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the
contributions.

For defined benefit retirement and medical pians, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit
credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. The present value
of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using market yields of
government bonds having terms approximating to the terms of related obligation.

Re-measurement, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and
the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other
comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Re-measurement recognised in other comprehensive income is
reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be rectassified to the statement of profit and loss. Past service cost
is recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period of a plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the

discount rate af the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are categorised
as follows:

. service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and
settlements);

. net interest expense or income; and
*  re-measurements

The Company presents the first two components of defined benefit costs in the statement of profit and loss in the line item
employee benefits expense. Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past service costs.

The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the actual deficit or surplus in the Company’s
defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits
available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.

A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of the
termination benefit or when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs which involves the payment of terminations
benefits.

Short-term and other long-term employee benefits

A liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages, salaries and bonus in the period the related
service is rendered at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service.

Liabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits
expected to be paid in exchange for the related service.

Liabilities recognised in respect of other long-term employee benefits such as annual leave and sick leave are measured at
the present value of the estimated future cash outflows expected to be made by the Company in respect of services provided
by employees up to the reporting date. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment
using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit retirement plans. Actuarial gains and losses arising
from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the statement of profit and
loss in the period in which they arise. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries.

The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the balance sheet if the entity does not have an unconditional right
to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting period, regardless of when the actual settlement is
expected to occur.

Critical accounting judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The Company provides both defined benefit employee retirement plans and defined contribution plans. Measurement of
pension and other superannuation costs and obligations under such plans require numerous assumptions and estimates
that can have a significant impact on the recognized costs and obligation, such as future salary level, discount rate, attrition
rate and mortality.

The Company provides defined benefit plans to its employees. The discount rate is based on Government bond yield.
Assumptions for salary increase in the remaining service period for active pian participants are based on expected
salary increase in India. Changes in these assumptions can influence the net asset or liability for the plan as well as the
pension cost.

Post-Employment Benefits

The Company provides various benefit plans to its employees. Some of them are defined benefit in nature while some
are contributory.

Defined Benefit Plans:

Major Post retiral defined benefit plans of the Company include Gratuity, Post retirement medical benefit and Provident
Fund (to the extent of Company's obligation to fund any shortfall on the yield of the trust’s investments over the
administered interest rates on an annual basis by Central Provident Fund Organisation of Goverment of India). The
Company does Actuarial valuation for its identified defined benefit plans.

Methodology for actuarial valuation of Defined Benefit Obligations:

The Projected Unit Credit (PUC) actuarial method has been used to assess the plan's liabilities, including those related
to death-in-service and incapacity benefits.

Under PUC method a projected accrued benefit is calculated at the beginning of the year and again at the end of

the year for each benefit that will accrue for all active members of the plan. The projected accrued benefit is based
on the plan’s accrual formula and upon service as of the beginning or end of the year, but using a member’s final
compensation, projected to the age at which the employee is assumed to leave active service. The plan liability is the
actuarial present value of the projected accrued benefits for active members.

Defined benefit plans expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: Interest Rate Risk, Salary Risk and Demographic
Risk.

Interest Rate Risk: While calculating the defined benefit obligation a discount rate based on government bonds yields
of matching tenure is used to arrive at the present value of future obligations. If the bond yield falls, the defined benefit
obligation will tend to increase and plan assets will decrease.

Salary risk: Higher than expected increases in salary will increase the defined benefit obligation.

Demographic risk: This is the risk of variability of results due to unsystematic nature of decrements that include
mortality, withdrawal, disability and retirement. The effect of these decrements on the defined benefit obligations is not
straight forward and depends on the combination of salary increase, discount rate and vesting criteria. It is important
not to overstate withdrawals because in the financial analysis the retirement benefit of a short career employee typically
costs less per year as compared to a long service employee.

Sensitivity analysis are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice,
this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be co-related. When calculating the sensitivity
of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method (present value of the defined
benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied

as when calculating the defined benefit liability recognised in the balance sheet.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company has certain defined contribution plans such as provident funds (not managed by Trust), superannuation
fund and family pension fund for the benefit of the employees. The Contributions are made to registered funds/
organisation administered by the government. The obligation of the Company is limited to the amount contributed and it
has no further contractual nor any constructive obligation.

Pension

It is a contributory benefit plan where the Company contributes a certain percentage of salary for all eligible employees
in the managerial cadre towards Superannuation Funds with option to put certain portion in National Pension Scheme
(NPS) and/or in funds managed by Birla Sunlife Insurance Company to be converted to annuity of Life Insurance

In respect of certain employees, the Company’s contribution towards Provident Fund as specified under the law is paid
to the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner and is debited to the Statement of Profit and Loss. The Company also
contributes to Coal Mines Provident Fund (CMPF) in respect of employees working in coal mines. The amount debited
to Statement of Profit and Loss during the year is ¥ 29 Crore (year ended 31/03/2024 & 29 Crore).

Other Employee Benefit plans

{a) Compensated Absences

The Compensated Absences cover the Company's liability for earned and sick leave. The entire amount of the
provision of € 341 Crore (year ended 31/03/2024 % 304 Crore) is presented as current, since the Company does
not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for these obligations. Expected amount towards settlement of
Leave for the next 12 months are f 50 Crore (31/03/2024 & 39 Crore) .

{b) Employee Share-based Payments
Equity settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the options at the grant date.

The fair value of option at the grant date is expensed over the respective vesting period in which all of the
specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied with a corresponding increase in equity as “Employee Stock
Options Account”. in case of forfeiture of unvested option, portion of amount already expensed is reversed. Ina
situation where the vested option forfeited or expires unexercised, the related balance standing to the credit of the
“Employee Stock Options Account” are transferred to the “Retained Earnings’.

When the options are exercised, the Company issues new equity shares of the Company of € 1/- each fully paid-
up. The proceeds received and the related balance standing to credit of the Employee Stock Options Account, are
credited to share capital (nominal value) and Securities Premium Account.

Share appreciation rights which are cash settled, are recognised as employee benefit expense over the relevant
service period. The liability is fair valued at each reporting date and are presented as employee benefit obligations
in the balance sheet.

Employee Stock Option Scheme administered by any independent trust is deemed as extended arm of the
Company and is consolidated in the standalone financial statements. When the options are exercised, the
trust transfers the appropriate number of shares to the employee. The proceeds received, net of any directly
attributable transaction costs, are credited directly to equity.

The Company has formulated employee share-based payment schemes with the objective to attract and retain
talent and align the interest of employees with the Company as well as to motivate them to contribute to its growth
and profitability. The Company views employee stock options as instruments that would enable the employees to
share the value they create for the Company in the years to come. At present, the following employee share-based
payment schemes are in operation, details of which are given below:

17. Revenue from Operations

The Company derives revenue principally from sale of hydrate, speciality alumina, aluminium and aluminium value
added products, di-ammonium phosphate, copper, precious metals (gold and silver) and other materials.

The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation in accordance with the contract with
the customer. This is achieved when contro! of the product has been transferred to the customer, which is generally
determined when legal title, physical possession, risk of obsolescence, loss and rewards of ownership pass to the
customer and the Company has the present right to payment, all of which occurs at a point in time upon shipment or
delivery of the product. in case of exports of goods, the Company considers shipping and handling activities as costs
to fulfil the promise to transfer the related products and the customer payments for shipping and handling costs are
recorded as a component of revenue.

In situations where revenue is recognized on shipment of goods, shipping and handling services are treated as
a distinct separate performance obligation and the Company recognises revenue for such services when the
performance obligation is completed and same are presented under the sale of services.

The Company considers the terms of the contract in determining the transaction price. The transaction price is based
upon the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring of promised goods and services
to the customer after deducting incentive programs, including but not limited to discounts, volume rebates etc.
Transaction price excludes taxes and duties collected on behalf of the government.

No element of significant financing is deemed present as the safes are made with a credit term, which is consistent with
market practice. The Company’s obligation to repair or replace faulty products under the standard warranty terms is
recognised as a cost with a corresponding provision.

For certain customer contracts, final prices are determined based on the underlying market index of commodity
prices at a future date, for example prices on the London Metal Exchange Limited (LME) or London Bullion Markets
Association (LBMA). In such contracts, the Company records revenue on a provisional basis considering current
market price when contro! is transferred to the customer. At the end of each period, prior to final settlement date,
adjustments are made to the provisional sale price based on movements in the underlying market index of commodity
prices up to the date of final price determination. Such variable price movement is accounted as other operating
revenue.

Revenue from irrevocable bill and hold/ holding certificate contracts is recognised when it is probable that delivery
will be made, goods have been identified and kept separately, are ready for delivery in the present condition and the
Company does not have the ability to use the product or fo direct it to another customer. Under these arrangements,
revenue is recognised once legal title has passed and control of the asset sold is transferred to the customer.

Export incentives and subsidies are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with
the conditions and the incentive will be received.

(d)

Revenue excludes any taxes and duties collected on behalf of the government.

of time. Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use
or sale.

Transaction costs in respect of long-term borrowings are amortised over the tenure of respective loans using effective
interest method. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

27. Earnings per Share (EPS)

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to the equity shareholders of the
Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average number

of equity shares outstanding during the period and for all periods presented is adjusted for events, such as bonus shares,
other than the conversion of potential equity shares that have changed the number of equity shares outstanding, without a
corresponding change in resources. Partly paid-up shares are included as fully paid equivalents according to the fraction
paid-up.

Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the
after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential equity shares and the weighted
average number of additional equity shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential
equity shares.

Treasury shares are excluded from weighted average numbers of equity shares used as a denominator in the calculation of
basic as well as diluted earnings per share.

Earning per share, earnings and number of shares are used as under:

Stock options granted to the employees under various ESOP schemes are considered to be potential equity shares. They
have been included in the determination of diluted earnings per share to the extent they are dilutive. 330,729 shares (year
ended 31/03/2024 469,370 Shares) options granted under Employee Stock option scheme but were not included in the
calculation of diluted earnings per share because they are antidilutive for the period. Options can potentially dilute basic
earnings per share in the future depending on future share price of the Company.The stock options have not been included in
the determination of basic earnings per share. For details relating to stock options, Refer Note 14B(b).

28. Government Grants

Government grants are recognized at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that we will comply with the conditions
attached to them and that the grants will be received.

Government grants whose primary condition is that the Company should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire non-
current assets are recognized in the balance sheet by setting up the grant as deferred income.

Grants arising on acquisition of non-current assets are accounted as deferred income and amortisation is recognised in
‘Other income’ on straight line basis over the expected useful lives of related assets.

Other government grants (grants related to income) are recognized as income over the periods necessary to match them
with the costs for which they are intended to compensate, on a systematic basis. Government grants that are receivable as
compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of providing immediate financial support with no
future related costs are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they become receivable.

Grants related to income are presented under ‘Other income’ or ‘Other Operating Revenue’ in the statement of profit and
loss depending upon the nature of the underlying grant, except for grants received in the form of rebate or exemptions related
to expenditures, which are deducted in reporting the related expense.

The Company is eligible for Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG), Manufacture and other Operations in Warehouse
Regulations (MOOWR) Scheme, Advance Authorisation (AA) Scheme and Other Miscellaneous grants.
Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG)

Under EPCG scheme, the group imports capital goods without payment of customs duty and in return the group is required
to fulfil export obligation within certain years equivalent to certain times of duty that has been saved while importing. Grants
are recognised in “Capital Work In Progress/Non-Current Asset” (PPE) at fair value with the corresponding recognition
under deferred income.

Manufacture and other Operations in Warehouse Regulations (MOOWR) Scheme

Under the MOOWR Scheme, the group conducts manufacturing or other operations in a Customs bonded warehouse and
imports goods under customs duty deferment. The deferment stands without any time limitation. Grants are recognised

in “Capital Work In Progress/Non-Current Asset” (PPE) at fair value with the corresponding recognition under deferred
income.

Advance Authorisation

Advance Authorization licenses are issued against import of inputs which are used in manufacturing of an export product
and there is obligation to export the finished goods. Thus, we account it in nature of “Income” as “Revenue Approach”.
Grants are recognised in inventory at the fair value of granti.e., the duty saved.

Other Miscellaneous grants

Other Export incentive includes RODTEP scheme on Export, Duty Drawback on Export, ES Certificate and others. These
are directly accounded under “Revenue”

Refer Note 16(b) for the details of Capital grant outstanding as “Deffered Income”.

Refer Note 17(b) for the details of nutrient based subsidy from sale of Diammonium phosphate (DAP) recognised under
“Revenue from Operations”.

Refer Note 17(d) for the details of export related Incentives and other benefits recognised under “Other Operating

Claims against Company not acknowledged as Debt:
Following demands are disputed by the Company and are not provided for:

The tax authorities issued an arbitrary demand notice to the Company for
payment of interest on Entry Tax. The Company has challenged the said notice
by filing a Writ Tax -218/2023 in the Allahabad High Court. The High Court by
its Order gave protection against any coercive action till next date of listing.
The challenge is to the power of levy of interest as well as legitimacy of such
levy in the face of the facts as well as applicable law.

Demand for Stamp Duty by Collector (Stamp), Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh (U.P.)

on merger of Copper Business of IndoGulf Corporation with the Company. The
matter is pending before the Hon’ble High Court of Allahabad. The Company
believes that there is no substantive/computation provision for levy/calculation
of stamp duty within the provisions of Uttar Pradesh Stamp Act on scheme

of arrangement under the Companies Act, 1956, approved by the Court.
Moreover, the properties in question are located in the State of Gujarat and,
thus, the Collector (Stamp), Kanpur, has no territorial jurisdiction to make such
ademand. Further, the Company has already paid the stamp duty for the same
in 2003-04 which has been accepted as per the provisions of the Bombay
Stamp Act, 1958.

Demand towards drawal of energy during peak hours by Uttar Pradesh Power
Corporation Limited (UPPCL)/ Purvanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited
(PVVNL).The dispute relates to the agreement entered with UPPCL for the
period 2009-14. Demand was raised by UPPCL for drawl of banked energy
during peak hours. The Hon’ble Supreme Court had stayed the demand.
Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) has remanded back the matter to
Uttar Pradesh Electrcity Regulatory Commission to decide afresh.

The Chakla coal mines was acquired by the Company through auction
conducted by the Nominated Authority (NA), constituted under the Ministry
of Coal, Government of India. As part of the Coal Mine Development and
Production Agreement (CMDPA), the Company was required to meet certain
efficiency parameters. Performance security in the form of Performance Bank
Guarantees (PBG) of ¥ 242 Crore were provided by the Company to NA in this
regard. On 20/06/2023, the NA issued a Show Cause Notice alleging that HIL
failed to meet the required efficiency parameters and proposed appropriating
10% of the PBG. The Company contested the notice as delay in securing
Environmental Clearance (EC), as required under the CMDPA was beyond
its control and therefore the required efficiency parameters could not be met.
NA recommended appropriation of the 10% of the PBG and also directed

the Company to provide PBG within 15 days. Aggrieved by this decision, the
Company filed a writ petition before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court challenging
the appropriation order and the Court granted a stay on the appropriation until
the next hearing. The matter remains pending, with the next date of hearing
scheduled for 11/09/2025.

Green Cess Provision Under Electricity Act Year-2012-13 to Year 2017-18. The
matter is pending at Hon’ble Supreme Court.

Retrospective revision of Water Rates by UP Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited. Writ
petition pending with Lucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court. The demand
for arrears stayed.

Demand for Entry Tax relating to valuation dispute pertaining to period 2002-
2014. Appeals have been filed with High Court, Odisha.

Itis not practicable for the Company to estimate the timings of cash outflows, if any, in respect of the above matters,
pending resolution of the respective proceedings.

Basis allegations, inter alia, of misutilization of coal mined in a mine deallocated in 2014-15, a chargesheet was filed

by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). On April 09, 2025, the Hon’ble Special Judge (Prevention of Corruption

Act) issued summons to the Company. CBI was directed to provide a complete copy of chargesheet with all relied upon
documents. Detailed review of the voluminous documents received on May 06, 2025 is currently underway. At present,
we are not aware of any judicial determinations or claims under the said proceedings which can have a quantifiable or
material financial implication on the Company. The Company continues to monitor all relevant developments in the matter
with appropriate diligence and affirms that it will revisit its disclosure obligations should any judicial finding, reading of

the chargesheet, interim directive, penalty, or adverse order arise in due course that could reasonably be construed as
material under applicable regulations.

using the earnings capitalisation method or discounted cash flow method. For inputs that are not observable for these
instruments, certain assumptions are made based on available information. The most significant of these assumptions
are the discount rate and credit spreads used in the valuation process.

For valuation of investments in debt securities categorised as level 3, market polls which represent indicative yields are
used as assumptions by market participants when pricing the asset.

There were no significant inter-relationships between unobservable inputs that materially affect fair values.

34. Financial Risk Management
The Company’s activities exposes it to various risks such as market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. This section explains
the risks, which the Company is exposed to and how it manages those risks.

(a)
10)

Market Risk
Commodity Price Risk

Hindalco’s India Operations consist of two businesses —- Copper Business and Aluminium Business. The Copper
Business works under a “Custom Smelting” model wherein the focus is to improve the processing margin. The timing
mis-match risk between the input and output price, which is linked to the same international pricing benchmark, is
eliminated through use of derivatives. This off-set hedge model (through use of derivatives) is used to manage the
timing mis-match risk for both Commodity (Copper and Precious Metals) and Currency Risk (primarily, USD/INR).
The Copper Business also has a portion of view based exposure for both Commodity and Currency, beyond the above
timing mis-match risk. Lower Copper prices, stronger USD/INR exchange rate and higher “Other Input” prices (eg Coal,
furnace oil, natural gas etc) are the major price risks that adversely impact the Business. Here, the Company may use
derivative instruments or non-derivative instruments, wherever available, to manage these pricing risks. A variety of
factors, including the risk appetite of the business and price view, are considered while taking hedging decisions. Such
view based hedges are usually done for the next 1-12 quarters.

The Aluminium Business is a vertically integrated business model wherein the input and output pricing risks are
independent of each other, i.e. - are on different pricing benchmarks, if any. Here, the Company may use derivative
instruments, wherever available, to manage its pricing risks for both input and output products. Lower aluminium
prices, weaker USD/INR exchange rate and higher input prices (e.g. Alumina, furnace oil, coal, coal tar pitch) are the
major price risks that adversely impact the Business. Hedging decisions are based on a variety of factors, including risk
appetite of the business and price View. Such hedge decisions are usually done for the next 1-12 quarters.

Embedded Derivatives

Copper concentrate is purchased on future pricing model based on month’s average LME (in case of copper) /LBMA

(in case of gold and silver). Since, the value of the concentrate changes with response to change in commodity pricing
indices, embedded derivatives (ED) is identified and segregated in the contract. The ED so segregated, is treated like

commodity derivative and qualify for hedge accounting. These derivatives are put into a Fair Value hedge relationship
with respect to inventory.

The table below summarises gain/(loss) impact of increase/decrease in the commodity price on the Company’s

equity and profit for the year:

Decrease in prices in all the above mentioned commodities, other than Aluminium Options, by 10% will have an equal
and opposite impact in the financial statements. Sensitivity analysis has been computed by stress testing the market
price of the underlying price index on the outstanding derivative position as on the reporting date by assuming all other
factors constant.

Foreign Currency Risk

Exchange rate movements, particularly the United States Dollar (USD) and Euro (EUR) against Indian Rupee (INR),
have an impact on our operating results. In addition to the foreign exchange inflow from exports, the commodity

prices in the domestic market are derived based on the landed cost of imports in India where LME prices and USD/
INR exchange rate are the main factors. In case of conversion business, the objective is to match the exchange rate of
outflows and related inflows through derivative financial instruments. With respect to Aluminium business where costs
are predominantly in INR, the strengthening of INR against USD adversely affects the profitability of the business and
benefits when INR depreciates against USD. The Company enters into various foreign exchange contracts to protect
profitability. The Company also enters into various foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the risk arising out of foreign
currency exchange rate movement in foreign currency contracts executed with foreign suppliers to procure capital
items for its project activities.

During the year ended, the Company’s foreign currency exposure arising from exports and import transactions resulted
in the FOB value of exports amounting to 16,642 Crore (31/03/2024 18,018 Crore) and the CIF value of imports
amounting to = 51,205 Crore (31/03/2024 & 45,715 Crore).

months before reporting date for trade receivables based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account
historical credit loss experience and adjusted for forward-looking information on macro economic factors affecting the
ability of the customers to settle the receivables. The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the days

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to
meet its contractual obligation.

Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, contractual cash flows of debt investments, favourable derivative
financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers
including outstanding receivables.

Credit risk is managed on an entity level basis. The Company has adopted a policy of dealing only with creditworthy
counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral, where appropriate, as a means of mitigating risk of financial loss
from defaults. The Company invests only in those instruments issued by high rated banks/ institutions and government
agencies. The Company assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past
experience and other factors. The Company’s investments in debt instruments and certain loans are considered to
have low credit risk. The credit ratings of the investments are monitored for credit deterioration.

For some trade receivables, the Company obtains security in the form of guarantees, deed of undertaking or letters of
credit which can be called upon if the counterparty is in default under the terms of the agreement.

The Company periodically monitors the recoverability and credit risks of its other financials assets including security
deposits and other receivables. The Company evaluates 12 months expected credit losses for all the financial assets
for which credit risk has not increased. In case credit risk has increased significantly, the Company considers life time
expected credit losses for the purpose of impairment provisioning.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally
enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset
and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be
enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the

counterparty.

Financial instruments subject to offsetting , enforceable master netting arrangement and similar arrangements.

being of the highest material importance. The identification of material issues has considered both internal

material issues were identified by a defined process of stakeholder engagement.
