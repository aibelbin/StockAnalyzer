partnership is now being deepened with
the addition of two crucial marine
propulsion systems:

¢ Controllable Pitch Propeller (CPP)
Systems

« Shafting Systems

CPP systems enable real-time adjustment
of blade pitch during operation,
providing precise thrust control,
enhanced fuel efficiency, and superior
maneuverability—crucial for modern
naval vessels. Shafting systems ensure
efficient power transfer from the main
engine to the propeller with high
accuracy and low acoustic signature,
vital for stealth operations.

Through this strategic alliance, LEWL
will develop and manufacture these
advanced propulsion systems
indigenously—traditionally reliant on
imports—making it one of the first
Indian companies to do so. This marks a
significant milestone in LEWL’s
contribution to the Government’s
Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative and
markedly improves India’s naval self-
sufficiency.

The partnership will facilitate access to
advanced engineering expertise from
FINCANTIERI S.p.A, enabling LEWL
to establish state-of-the-art
manufacturing and testing infrastructure,
nurture a skilled workforce, and become
a preferred supplier for both domestic
and international naval programmes.
This development coincides with LEWL
experiencing strong growth in its defence
engineering segment. As of FY25, the
company’s current order book in the
defence sector exceeds Rs 100 Crs, with
increasing prospects for future contracts.
This collaboration aids in long-term
revenue growth and expansion of
LEWL’s defence sector.
