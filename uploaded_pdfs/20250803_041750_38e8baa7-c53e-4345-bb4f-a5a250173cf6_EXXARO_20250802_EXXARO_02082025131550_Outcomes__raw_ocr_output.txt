INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REVIEW REPORT ON REVIEW OF UNAUDITED
STANDALONE INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS

To
Board of Directors,
Exxaro Tiles Limited

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of Unaudited Standalone Financial
Results of Exxaro Tiles Limited (“the Company”) for the quarter ended June 30,
2025 ("the Statement") attached herewith, being submitted by the Company
pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended.

This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s management and has
been approved by the Company's Board of Directors, has been compiled from the
related financial statements which has been prepared in accordance with the
recognition and measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting
Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”) prescribed under Section
133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with relevant rules issued thereunder {ind
AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility
is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review of such
standalone financial statements.

We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on
Review Engagements (SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information
Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI}. A review of interim financial information
consists of making inquiries, primarily of the Company's personnel responsible for
financial and accounting matters and applying analytical and other review
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the
Companies Act, 2013 and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance
that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an
audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that
causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance
with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in aforesaid Indian
Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013
read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting practices and
principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to
be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended, including the manner in
which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
