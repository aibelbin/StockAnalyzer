destocking in one of the large CDMO product, the YoY revenue growth was in early double-digit

accompanied by improvement in EBITDA margin, especially at our overseas sites. Growth in our CHG business
is also expected to pick up for the remaining part of the year given the timing of some of the institutional orders.
Our consumer business delivered healthy growth, in-line with our expectations, driven by power brands and e-
commerce sales.

Withstanding the near-term challenges, we believe we are on track to achieve our FY2030 aspirations of

Key Business Highlights for Q1 FY2026

Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO):

Mid-teens growth in base business i.e. excluding impact of destocking in one large on-patent

product manufacturing site for both human and veterinary use
