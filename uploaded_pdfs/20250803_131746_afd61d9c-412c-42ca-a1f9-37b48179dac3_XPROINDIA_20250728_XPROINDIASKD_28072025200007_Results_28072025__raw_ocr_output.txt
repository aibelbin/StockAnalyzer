Independent Auditor’s Review Report on Unaudited Standalone Quarterly Financial Results
of Xpro India Limited pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended)

To the Board of Directors of Xpro India Limited

1.

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results (‘the
Statement’) of Xpro India Limited (‘the Company’) for the quarter ended 30 June 2025, being
submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEB! (Listing
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) (‘Listing
Regulations’).

The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's management and approved by the
Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and
measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34. Interim Financial
Reporting (‘Ind AS 34’), prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’),
and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the
presentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our
responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review

We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review
Engagements (SRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the
independent Auditor of the Entity, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A
review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters. and applying analytical and other review
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act. and consequently, does
not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that
might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
