Independent Auditor’s Review Report on the Quarterly and Year to Date Unaudited Financial Results of the
Company Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)
Regulations, 2015, as amended

Review Report to
The Board of Directors
Bharat Seats Limited

1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results of Bharat Seats Limited (the
“Company”) which includes one_Branch Operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 and year to date from
April 1, 2025 to June 30, 2025 (the “Statement”) attached herewith, being submitted by the Company pursuant
to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)
Regulations, 2015, as amended (the “Listing Regulations”).

2. The Company’s Management is responsible for the preparation of the Statement in accordance with the
recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, (Ind AS 34) “Interim
Financial Reporting” prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant
rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with
Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. The Statement has been approved by the Company’s Board of
Directors. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review.

3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements
(SRE) 2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the
review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review of
interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope
than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain
assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly,
we do not express an audit opinion.

4, Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in
the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS") specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013
as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in
India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of the Listing Regulations, including
the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

5. Emphasis of matter — Income Tax Search

We draw attention to Note 4 of the financial results which describes the uncertainty relating to outcome of a
search conducted by the Income Tax Department in an earlier year, under Section 132 of the Income Tax Act,

1961, at certain premises of the Company including manufacturing locations and residence of few of its
employees/key managerial personnel.

Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter.

6. The accompanying Statement of quarterly and year-to-date interim financial results includes unaudited financial
results in respect of:

e One branch, whose interim financial results reflect total revenues of Rs. Nil and Rs. Nil, total net loss after
tax of Rs. 39.80 lacs and Rs. 39.80 lacs and total comprehensive loss of Rs. 39.80 lacs and Rs. 39.80 lacs
for the quarter ended and for the period ended on that date respectively, as considered in the Statement
based on their interim financial results/financial statements and other financial information which have not
been audited/reviewed by any respective branch auditors.
