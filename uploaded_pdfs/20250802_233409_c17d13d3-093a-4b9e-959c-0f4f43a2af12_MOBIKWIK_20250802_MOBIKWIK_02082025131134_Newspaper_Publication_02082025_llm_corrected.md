## TCS assures govt: All job offers intact, just delayed

TATA CONSULTANCY SERVICES (TCS) has assured the ministry of labour that it remains committed to honouring all job offers it has made, even as it faces delays in onboarding due to global market challenges. The IT major submitted its response via email to the chief labour commissioner (CLC), citing deferred client projects as the reason behind the hold-up in inducing new hires.

The labour ministry had sought clarity from TCS following a complaint by the tech employees’ union Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES), which flagged delays in onboarding for around 600 lateral hires and raised concerns about the company’s proposed plan to lay off 12,000 employees in the coming months. Although a representative from NITES attended the meeting convened by the CLC, TCS chose to submit its reply in writing.

In its response, TCS attributed the delays to “prevailing global market conditions” and maintained that such fluctuations in hiring timelines are routine in the IT industry, especially when project schedules are impacted. The company, however, was dismissive of the union’s role, questioning its standing to intervene in the matter and noting that the complainant had “not established its locus standi”.

NITES, for its part, submitted a representation demanding a definitive onboarding timeline, compensation for affected candidates, mental health support, and assistance for those who have already relocated. The union also raised broader allegations, including forced resignations and violations of labour laws, but the CLC observed that these claims lacked supporting documentation.

## Renault takes full control of Chennai plant

FRENCH AUTO MAJOR Renault on Friday announced that it has formally taken over Nissan's 51% stake in their joint venture, Renault Nissan Automotive India Private Ltd (RNAIPL), becoming the sole owner of the Chennai manufacturing facility.

The move is part of Renault Group’s broader strategy to scale up its India operations across the value chain—from design to manufacturing. In April, the company inaugurated its largest design centre outside France in Chennai, followed by the launch of the Renault Triber, the first among four new models in its upcoming product line-up.

“The company aims to strengthen its sales in the Indian market and expand its exports from this major industrial hub,” Renault said in a statement. The takeover follows Renault’s March announcement to acquire Nissan's stake in RNAIPL as part of its India-focused growth plan, which also aligns with Nissan's ongoing global turnaround strategy. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) cleared the transaction earlier this week. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.
