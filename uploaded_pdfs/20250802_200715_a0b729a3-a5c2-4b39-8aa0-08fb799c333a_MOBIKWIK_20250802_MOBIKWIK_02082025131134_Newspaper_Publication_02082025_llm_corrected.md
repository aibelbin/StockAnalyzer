## TCS Assures Govt: All Job Offers Intact, Just Delayed

URVI MALVANIA
Mumbai, August 1

TATA CONSULTANCY SERVICES (TCS) has assured the ministry of labour that it remains committed to honouring all job offers it has made, even as it faces delays in onboarding due to global market challenges. The IT major submitted its response via email to the chief labour commissioner (CLC), citing deferred client projects as the reason behind the hold-up in inducing new hires.

The labour ministry had sought clarity from TCS following a complaint by the tech employees’ union Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES), which flagged delays in onboarding for around 600 lateral hires but plans global workforce realignment.
