To,

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
SUMMIT SECURITIES LIMITED

1. We have reviewed the accompanying unaudited standalone financial results of Summit Securities Limited (the “Company”) for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, which are included in the accompanying ‘Statement of unaudited Standalone financial results for the Quarter ended June 30, 2025 (the “Statement”) being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) from time to time. We have initialed the Statement for identification purposes only.

2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s Management and approved by the Company’s Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”), read with the relevant Rules issued thereunder, the circulars, guidelines and directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) from time to time (the “RBI Guidelines”) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, and is in compliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, 2015 including relevant circulars issued by SEBI from time to time and that it has been prepared in accordance with the relevant prudential norms issued by the RBI in respect of income recognition, assets classification, provisioning and other related matters, to the extent those are not inconsistent with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act. Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Statement based on our review.

3. We conducted our review in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (‘SRE’ 2410, ‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provides less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement has not been prepared in accordance with recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under Section 133 of the Act, read with the relevant Rules issued thereunder, the RBI Guidelines and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, and has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, 2015, including relevant circulars issued by SEBI from time
