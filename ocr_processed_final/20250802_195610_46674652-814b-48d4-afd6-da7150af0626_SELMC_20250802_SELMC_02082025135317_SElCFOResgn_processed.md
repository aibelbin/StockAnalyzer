## SUB : RESIGNATION FROM THE POST OF CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
Dear Sir,

After careful consideration, I am writing to formally resign from my position as Chief Financial Officer at SEL Manufacturing Co. Ltd., effective July 31st, 2025.

It has been an immense privilege to serve this organization for the past 21 years. Over these two decades, I have witnessed and contributed to our company’s growth, transformation, and continued success. The journey has been both professionally and personally rewarding, and I am deeply grateful for the trust and support extended to me by the Board, my colleagues, and the entire team.

This decision was not made lightly. However, after much reflection, I believe this is the right time for me to pursue new challenges and allow fresh leadership to guide the company into its next phase of growth.

I am committed to ensuring a seamless transition. Over the coming weeks, I will work closely with the leadership team to facilitate knowledge transfer, support succession planning, and maintain business continuity.

Thank you once again for the opportunities, mentorship, and camaraderie I have experienced at SEL Manufacturing Co. Ltd. I look forward to seeing the company continue to thrive and achieve even greater heights.
With sincere appreciation and best wishes,
Navneet Gupta
