Dear Shareholder,

Ref : ‘Saksham Niveshak’ — Special Reminder to update KYC and bank details to claim Equity
Shares and Unpaid/Unclaimed Dividend prior to the transfer to the Investor Education and
Protection Fund (IEPF) (July 28, 2025 to November 6, 2025)

This has reference to the provisions of Section 124 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’), read
with the Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority (Accounting, Audit, Transfer and
Refund) Rules, 2016, (‘the Rules’), as amended. The Act and the Rules, inter alia, contain
provisions for transfer of unclaimed dividend and share(s), in respect of which dividend(s} has not
been claimed by the shareholder(s) for seven consecutive years or more, to the IEPF Authority.

As per our records, dividend declared by the Company from FY2019 to FY2025, as the case may
be, have remained unpaid / unclaimed in respect of your shareholding in ICICI Prudential Life
Insurance Company Limited. Details of such unclaimed dividend(s) are available on the website

of the Company at www.iciciprulife.com.

To claim the outstanding dividend amount before it is transferred to the IEPF, you are requested
to send us the unpaid Dividend Warrant(s) or alternatively, please return the letter-cum-
indemnity as appended below duly signed by you, in order to re-issue the unclaimed dividend(s).

We request you to kindly register/update your KYC and bank account details with Registrars to
the Issue and Share Transfer Agent (RTA)/your Depository Participant to receive the dividend
electronically. The dividend payment will be processed if the request is found appropriate in all
respects. In case of any discrepancies or if the documents are inadequate/incomplete, the
request is liable to be rejected and the Company will proceed to transfer the unclaimed
dividend(s) for the mentioned years along with the corresponding shares in respect of which
dividend has not been claimed for seven consecutive years to the IEPF as per applicable
regulations. Kindly note that no claim shall lie against the Company in respect of shares or
dividend transferred to the IEPF as per the aforesaid rules.

The concerned shareholders may approach the IEPF authorities to claim the transferred dividend
amount and shares as prescribed under the IEPF Rules.

Please note that in the absence of bank details registered against your account with the RTA
/ Depository Participant, the payment of outstanding dividend amount cannot be effected.


Please also note that in case the dividend(s) amounts are not claimed the Equity Share(s) in
respect of which the dividend{s) have remained unclaimed shall be transferred to the IEPF
Authority in accordance with the notification(s) issued by Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA)
from time to time, without any further notice to you and no liability shall lie against the
Company in respect of the Equity Shares so transferred.

All future benefits arising on such shares would also be transferred to IEPF Authority.

The shareholders/their legal heirs/nominees, as the case may be, may further note that the details
of unclaimed dividend(s) and share(s) of the concerned shareholder(s) uploaded by the Company
on its website at www.iciciprulife.com shall be treated as adequate notice in respect of issue of
the new share certificate(s) by the Company for the purpose of transfer of shares in favour of IEPF
Authority pursuant to the Rules. Please note that no claim shall lie against the Company in respect
of unclaimed dividend(s) and equity shares transferred to the IEPF.

In case concerned shareholders wish to claim the dividend and shares after transfer to IEPF, a
separate application has to be made to the IEPF Authority in Form IEPF-5 electronically, as
prescribed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and available on its website at www.iepf.gov.in.
