# Unit-3 Mahad - A Solid Note for FY'26


I would request Mr. Shiven Arora - Managing Director of Blue Jet Healthcare Limited to provide you with the updates for the quarter ended 30th June 2025. Thank you and over to you, sir.


Thank you, Advait. Good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.


## A Solid Start to FY'26


I am pleased to share that we have started FY'26 on a solid note. Our Q1 Results reflect sustained momentum from the second half of last year. Despite the expected normalization of some uptick in demand should that happen in the near future. At Unit-3 Mahad, we were creating a capacity for backward integration for the CMI segment.


## A Highly Engineered Plant


This is a highly engineered plant based on flow synthesis, will be the first that we will have for making the KSM for our CMI product.


Work is in progress in full swing, and as indicated, the site should be ready for validations and will go on stream in second half of FY'26.


## Strengthening Our Position


With this plant going on stream, we will strengthen our position as a credible and leading supplier of CMI to all the leading innovator companies in this segment.


## Backward Integration


We further demonstrate our resolve to retain a leadership position in the CMI segment. With this backward integration, we not only achieve strategic independence, but also insulate the business from significant volatility of the key raw material pricing.


## Opportunities in CDMO Business


As a country, we are experiencing significant tailwinds for the CDMO business. There has been a huge surge in RFPs. While our focus has historically been on the chronic segment, we had been building capacity to supply building blocks and peptide fragments to innovators, and also the global CDMOs engaged in this field.


## Future Expansion Plans


Given the interest that we are seeing in this segment, we are advancing with a plan to build a multipurpose plant at Mahad and a state-of-the-art R&D center at Hyderabad. The GMP compliant approximately 30 reactor plant will be a versatile plant with capability to supply from a few kilos to multi-tons to our CDMO clients in any geography.


## Automation and CAPEX


At Mahad, both in the block meant for vertical integration and the multipurpose block we believe which will go on stream in H2 FY'27, a high level of automation is being built to ensure batch-to-batch consistency, optimal leans, and risk-proof operations. As a consequence of this high level of versatility and automation that is being built into the Unit-3 Mahad, we envisage that the earlier planned CAPEX of Rs. 250 crores for Unit-3 shall increase to about Rs. 300 crores. Of this, about Rs. 100 crores has already been incurred, and the balance Rs. 200 crores will be incurred up to FY27.


## State-of-the-Art R&D Center


The state-of-the-art R&D center being built at a cost of about Rs. 40 crores shall focus on the newer chemistry platforms like peptides, intermediates for GLP-1s, biocatalysis with a focus on immobilized catalysts, and work to augment and strengthen the innovator-oriented pipeline of the company with a focus on chronic diseases.


## Carbon Sequestration


As a company, we are committed to carbon sequestration. We are conscious about the environment, and our carbon footprint is consistently reducing. We contribute about 70% of our overall energy consumption from wind and solar.


Now I come to the most interesting part of this readout, our future expansion plans:

## Kunal Dhamesha, Ganesh Karuppannan, Shiven Arora, and Moderator: Meet Katrodiya

Blue Jet Healthcare Limited
July 22, 2025

And then, I have more questions. I will come back. See, if I look at this change in finished goods, we are actually back to the **53%** levels.

So, like this is just an issue which is relevant only for this.

On a regular basis, we don't see any change in the gross margin with this current product.

So, we have a couple of new launches which are slated for Q2 and Q3 and could actually come back or if there is any changes in when this iodinated new product comes in, you can actually see the change in the numbers.

So, should we expect it to improve from the levels, current levels or how should we think about it?

We don't give guidance on the future. So, based on the current portfolio mix, it's going to be **53%** and we will be in a position to sustain similar levels in the coming quarters.

Okay. And this **53%** you mentioned is the 53 days of finished goods inventory?
No, this is **53%** of gross margin.

But let's say finished good inventory now, where would we and then is it in line with our expectations?

So, in terms of inventory days, there is no significant change. It came down by 131 days, that is working capital to total turnover. We should be around similar range way forward.

Okay. Sure. And then second one on the iodinated intermediate. So, we are seeing that the block is ready, capacity is ready and it would get commissioned or will start supplying in Q2. Is the way to understand?
Yes. That is the right assumption.

Sure. And what's the capacity in terms of let's say reactor capacity or let's say tons, if you could share and how do we expect the ramp up to be? Will it be like a gradual ramp up or step jump?

In terms of what I can share right now, the net realization per kg improves significantly with this launch, we won't be able to disclose the volume or KL capacity. But from a criticality standpoint, and our growth journey, this is a fairly good needle mover.

Sure. And one on the pharmaceutical intermediate, I believe that we had suggested that **120 KL** capacity is what we had put for the cardiovascular intermediate. Is that number correct?

That's the right assumption. **120 KL** is what we've indicated. That's the right number. Happy to get on with the questions, please. Thank you.
Yes. I have more questions. I will join back the queue. Thank you.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Meet Katrodiya from Niveshaay. Please go ahead.Here is the reformatted text:

# Strong Order Book Visibility
## So, just wanted to understand that. It's actually maybe it's a wrong wording I had used.

It's not phasing out of inventory.
It's basically like reduction in inventory. I think that's the way you have to look at it.

So, production or utilization levels were not lower on a QOQ basis, right? Just wanted to understand that.

No, the productions are based on customer orders. So, we have a very sustained production. So, this is something certain inventory produced in the last quarter got sold in this quarter.

Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. My second question was on the new launches that you pointed to in 2Q and 3Q. So, does that include the iodinated intermediate and any other launch from other business segments? Just wanted to understand which were the two new products that you were alluding to?

## Iodinated AB HCL and Backward Integration
So, in contrast media itself from an H2 perspective, there's this iodinated AB HCL that we spoke about. And there is the backward integration that we are doing. So, these are the two material launches. However, there are a few other intermediates that we supply to newer contrast agents. These are newer applications with some innovators. These are all lab quantities but have a promising future. So, this is more about contrast media. About pharma intermediates, pharma intermediates also, there are new opportunities that we are tracking. As I mentioned that some of them are in phase 3 and late phase and a couple of them are already commercial. So, I think there are interesting opportunities there also.

# Land Return and Larger Parcel
## Any particular reason is behind?

Actually, our application has been for a much, much larger parcel. But today in the red category, Gujarat does not have too much of land. So, we got about 8 acres. We took that, but then we felt that that was subscale because now we have spotted and in the process of finalizing a much, much larger piece of land. Therefore, it was logical for us to surrender this in view of the much larger parcel of land that we would be acquiring very shortly. And we will make an announcement about that, which is in step with the aspiration that the company has.

# Inventory and Production
## My second question is in line with the previous participant only. Since we have lowered down our inventory into this quarter and our sales at overall level is more than the previous quarter, then we must have ramped down our production level into this quarter?

Yes. Our closing inventory of finished goods is lower compared to previous quarter. And we have the production plan in place for Q2 and Q3, which will actually get back to the original levels.

Got it. So, what is our sustainable level of inventory that we want to maintain?

No, it is more than sustainable level. It is more to do with the customer order and because we make based on customer order, so it is dependent on that.

Okay. I will fall back into the queue for further questions.

# Accounting Policy
## Finished goods is never valued on sale price. It is basically raw material plus associated overheads. Any direct overhead gets allocated.

Finished goods is never valued on sale price. It is basically raw material plus associated overheads. Any direct overhead gets allocated. This is the accounting principle every company follows in valuing the finished goods. So, you can easily understand what is the raw material cost and what is the direct overheads which gets allocated. So, in a quarter where you have a larger finished goods, you would have actually inventorized certain overheads, the direct overheads and if you maintain similar inventory levels quarter on quarter, you do not see that impact in the P&L.

# Capex Expansion
## Second question, sir, is on the Capex, which our CEO mentioned that we want to add 1,000 KL capacity in the next two to three years. And we start with phase I of four blocks, two of them for CMI, one for high intensity sweetener, and one in MPB block.

Given the growth happening in the pharma intermediate molecule and given what our customers are preparing for in the future, why no CAPEX towards this as where I understand we are at 60%, but why no Capex towards pharma intermediate in the next phase of expansion?

I think maybe the voice drained off and maybe you were not able to hear. Pharma intermediates is becoming an important part of the entire scheme of the company. There is one block that will come up in Mahad, which we very clearly mentioned, that's like a multipurpose block, will be catering to this segment. And even for our new big land parcel that we spoke about, our expansion plan for the future, there also we mentioned that there's going to be a multipurpose block which will be catering to this third product vertical. So, I think we are building up good capacity in anticipation of the RFPs that we have.

I think just to add on to that, as a company DNA, when we have a customer lock-in and a contract visibility, that’s when we initiate a thought process of adding a particular block. And that's how we see in contrast media also, we believe that two additional blocks should be added due to certain discussions with the customers and the innovators.

Just to follow up on this, given that we are already doing backward integration into APD for our contrast media intermediates. And we are putting up two more blocks for contrast media. So, what could be the roadmap for contrast media from here?

The end formulation market is definitely growing. And from $6.7 billion in terms of end formulation is projected to become $10 billion in the next few years. So, in anticipation of this growth, we have a strong push from our customers also to add capacities to take care of these growing demands.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bansi Desai. Please go ahead.Here is the reformatted text in markdown:

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bansi Desai. Please go ahead.

## My question is again on contrast media

So, if I just look at this business for us for the last two to three years, we've been in that range, or in fact, you know, looking at this quarter's number at Rs. 97 crores, we are much below our quarterly run rate that we've seen in this business even two years back.

So, from a Rs. 500 crore business in fiscal 23, we came down to Rs. 480 crores in fiscal '24. We came down to Rs. 400 crores in fiscal '25 probably because of customers' changes in the facility, et al.

But starting this year, we are again at Rs. 97 crores.

So, if you can just help us understand, probably two years back, we would have thought that end market is growing at mid to high single digit, Blue Jet launching more molecules, you should have been grown probably at mid-single digit or higher than that.

And from there to here, we are still probably at this run rate of 97 crores. So, are we going to see a step up again in this business from the new launches that you are guiding?

And if one has to look at two to three-year view, maybe quarterly is not the right way to look at the numbers.

I understand that.

But if I have to take two to three-year view, how should one think about growth for Contrast Media?

Bansi, there are three levers. One is the largest customer, the forecast, whatever they have indicated to us, the iodinated product, and the intermediate for the gadolinium molecule. Now, if we look at all the three together, there is a good probability we should actually get back to the 23 levels. I think that is our aspiration. So, that's what we are working on. So, this would actually become a new base for us. If we could actually reach the 23 level in 25 or 26, then we can actually build on, you will obviously have the growth on the iodinated molecule, you will actually see the full year impact in FY'27. And the NCE molecule also would grow in 27-28.

And in the meantime, we do expect certain new opportunities, which we are actually planning from FY28, 29, what VK and Shiven alluded to in terms of additional capacities for Contrast Media.

## Capacity Utilization

What I mentioned was for the PI segment, that particular block that we had created, just to give a sense that should there be an increase in demand, we are well poised to capture that. Overall, I think at a company level, maybe 75%.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ravi Purohit from Securities Investment Management Private Limited. Please go ahead.

## Question on API and Contrast Media

Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Sir, I've been kind of reading our environment clearance report for the new Mahad unit, right? And in that, we have provided a list of products where we are adding capacities. And one of them is also API for Bempedoic Acid, right? So, I think so far we've been doing only the intermediate. So, in Bempedoic Acid, are we looking to add API facility, API capacity as well? And similarly, in Contrast Media, we are putting up two new blocks in the new large capacity that we are planning to set up over the next 2 to 3 years. Now, there also historically, we've been, are we kind of looking to add larger API capacities in many of these, where the value of the end product, of course, could be significantly larger than what we have been getting in the intermediate? So, if you could just share some thoughts and some color on where we are headed on either of these, both PI as well as the Contrast Media on the journey from intermediate to whether we will or will not be doing APIs.

So, if you will see our performance over the last couple of years, three, four, five years, you will see that our per KL realizations have gone up significantly and very consecutively. And our per kg realizations have also gone up from building blocks to intermediates, advanced intermediates. Now, both in our Contrast Media and PI, what we supply to our clients are very advanced intermediates, which are just one or two steps short of the final API. The final API could be a logical extension. But as you know, and Shiven also mentioned what the DNA of the company is, we always do it with a specific client lock-in and client interest. So, it has to come from one of our existing clients. We don't wish to participate in the generic space. As far as your reading of our environmental clearance is concerned, while the advanced intermediate that we make for Bempedoic is just two steps away from the final API. But then many a times we give a laundry list of products because going back to the EC for amendments of the product list is not very convenient nor efficient.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ajay from Niveshaay. Please go ahead.

## Expectations with Contrast Media

Thank you for the opportunity. My question is on contrast media. So, as mentioned by the previous participants that the speed of growth has been slow, but we also believe the big scale can be achieved in this business with forward integration. So, sequentially, how or what are your expectations with this segment going ahead? And do we plan to forward integrate?

So, there's a clear roadmap for that. But as we mentioned that we always do it for the customers on a CDMO model. We don't participate in the generic space. So, I think as it pans out we will keep you updated. At this point of time, we cannot comment any more than what we have.

## Inventory and Overheads

Got it. And last question. Again, this is on the inventory. You mentioned that there was under-absorbed overhead, and this is typically due to the lower production, which we also expect going forward to pick up, which will eventually result in sales or sales coming quarters, which will result in better absorption of fixed costs. So, my question is, in case this doesn't happen, what are the steps being taken to absorb or manage these overheads going forward? And if you can also highlight the range of gross margins what we should look at, that would be helpful.

It is not under-absorption of overheads. It is the overhead inventorized in the previous quarter getting released to P&L in this quarter. Okay? So, it is not that, under-absorption is completely a different topic. So, this is nothing to do with under-absorption.

Let me know if you need any further adjustments!Here is the reformatted text in markdown:

# we are still evaluating the options. Okay, sir. Thank you. Thank you.

## The next question is from the line of Bansi Desai from JP Morgan.

Please go ahead.

Hi.

Thanks again for the opportunity.

Just on the PI-API for the cardiovascular product, it appears that the realizations have remained pretty stable, is that true?

And therefore, if the realizations, say for instance, were to remain stable and if we were to see increased uptake in quantity, should we assume this kind of run rate to continue?

With the current cost structure, our margins are intact.

No, sir. I was talking about the revenue for the PI-API?

Yes. I mean, as you know, Bansi, the molecule is doing extremely well. And I think what we have done at the annual level, that we should be able to maintain with some growth in that.
Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Abhishek Sharma from D&H Electrodes Pvt. Ltd. Please go ahead.

Hello. Good evening, sir. Sir, is there any cyclical pattern in the company's revenue organization? Just like that in the first half of the financial year, typically constitutes a lower portion of annual revenues compared to the second half.

We do not have any seasonality in our industry. It is all more to do with customer orders. Sanjay, you want to add on?

Sir, this is basically, this is all related to, we are into make-to-order. So, as and when order is there, we manufacture. So, there is no cyclical, it is not a formulation company.

Okay. Thank you.

Thank you.

## The next question is from the line of Vidit Shah from Spark Capital. Please go ahead.

Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Sir, two questions I had. Sir, one was, while I understand that inventory has hit the P&L, I would assume that revenue too would be booked in the same quarter. So, I'm still confused around why margins have taken such a sharp decline, unless there were one-off overheads which have been recognized in the quarter. But happy to take that offline if you may. But my second question was on why are we seeing reduced levels of inventory?

Why are we consciously reducing levels of inventory in Q1?

Basically, I mean, in simple words, it says the movement of COGS that is not going to those. So, if you see, whenever the inventory goes down, COGS goes up in simple accounts. So, that is the impact. So, inventory has reduced.

But the revenue would also go up in the same way, right? So, margins may not be impacted.

Yes, but the revenue has also gone up. But the stock was lying in the last quarter. It got displaced this quarter. Got it?

Okay.

So, the movement, if you see the movement, is the impact of COGS. And of course, overhead and all is there, but this movement of COGS, basically. So, just mmus raw material cost, which is the gross margin and remove the COGS, still the margin is around 52%.

Okay. Maybe we can take that offline. But if you could just help me understand why are levels of inventory decreasing? Is that a conscious effort? Or is this a plant maintenance sort of?

No, this is more of a customer's dispatch schedule. So, each customer has their dispatch schedule. So, it is more to do with their logistics planning.

Okay. So, would that be fair to assume then that Q2, the dispatches may not be as much as Q1? Is that how to look at it?

Not exactly. So, this is because we have our production schedule for Q2, Q3. So, whatever happened in Q1 should not have impact on the production of Q2.

Okay. Those were my two questions. Thanks for answering them and all the best. Thank you.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kunal Dhamesha from Macquarie. Please go ahead.

Hi, thank you for the follow-up question. My question is primarily on the peptide segment. If you could help us understand the capabilities that we have, what are our aspirations there, and then, what is the capacity that we are planning and where it would be Capex required, so that would be great.

See, on the peptide segment, we are working on peptide fragments. At the R&D stage, we are working on some peptides, but then what is more advanced and what we are discussing with certain innovator companies are the intermediates to the end peptides, some of them being the GLP-I products where we are in a conversation with certain innovator companies for the intermediates. So, basically, we are working on the amino acid derivatives and peptide fragments. Till the time we build our multipurpose plant in Mahad, the smaller requirements that will be there in this segment will be catered to from the multipurpose plant in Unit 2. When the Mahad capacity comes in, that will address this business segment and demand. And as I mentioned that in the larger scale of things, when we have this much, much larger land parcel and capacity that we plan to create in the next couple of years, there will be capacity for this segment there also. It will all be in step with the client lock-in and visibility of business that we have.

So, when we say this fragments, would it be more like dipeptide, tripeptide or octamer, decamer, what are we trying to kind of achieve here? And then in terms of the technology that we would be adopting, whether it's chemical synthesis and on a large-scale basis, would it continue or we are also looking at the other type of technology available there?

See, as I mentioned that we are doing amino acid derivatives. We will not be making the amino acid, which are on fermentation-based technologies. As we speak, we have developed already about 45 peptide fragments. We are not in the library or catalog type of business, where we do 300 or 400. There's a big opportunity over there, but that's not what we are focusing. We are working on those where there's high conviction and client visibility. We are, since I mentioned peptide fragments, then we are not really talking about tripeptides, tetrapeptides or the decapeptides. We have in the new R&D center that we are creating, we will have one lab which will be doing peptide synthesis, but then the high conviction opportunities that we are tracking are more on the fragment side.

Sure, maybe I will take it offline. I need to get more details around this. Thank you for your answer.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ravi Purohit from Securities Investment Management Pvt. Ltd. Please go ahead.

My question also was similar to the previous participants’ questions. Amino acid chains and the fragments are not very easy to establish. Is it something that we are working on and will eventually showcase to clients or we have already established certain processes and certain products on existing showcase to clients? Where are we in that? Is it something that we aspire to do or certain products or certain chains we've already established and it's only a matter of talking to the client, showing to them what we are capable of and have a capacity to basically manufacture? Because what we understand is the chain is not very easy to kind of produce and replicate.

You need a specialized skill set for this, which we have. We have been working on this type of chemistry for the last two, two and a half years. We have a couple of scientists who are extremely good in this type of synthesis. As I mentioned, we are not in the catalogue business. As we speak, we are not venturing now. We already have about 45 peptide fragments which are already ready. They can be commercialized almost immediately. This preparation or readiness that we have is quite significant.

This preparation or readiness that we have is based upon customer interest.

# There's no blue sky gazing in this

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ankit Sahay from Fusion Capital. Please go ahead.

**Gross Margin Question**
What is your question on gross margin?

You mentioned the right to look at a consolidated financial report for Q4 FY'25 and Q1 FY'26. Why do that and why should revenue be recorded in Q4 itself and not in Q1?

Unless you make a sale, then only you can recognize the revenue. In our case, you have both finished goods and goods in transit. Certain finished goods are recognized as sale only when it reaches the customer destination. So, the finished goods has two parts. One is what we physically have at site and the second one is in transit because certain Incoterms allows us to recognize revenue only when it reaches the customer. When you take both of this, you have this, I would actually call it more as an aberration for this quarter. I would actually say this is more an accounting issue, the way Sanjay put it across. When the inventory gets released, this overhead absorption happens. I think had we maintained a similar finished goods level like last quarter; you would not have seen this impact.

Yes, got it. So, overhead from the last quarter is coming here because the inventory levels are reduced.

# Next Question
Thank you. The next question is from the line of Saket from Sagari Capital. Please go ahead.

**CDMO RFPs and Product Pipeline**
Thanks for the opportunity. So, we talked about a lot of traction as far as CDMO RFPs are concerned. So, could you share details around, say, how many projects we have currently across different phases, say, in Q1 and what was the corresponding number, say, last year just to get a sense of how has the product pipeline in the CDMO or especially in the pharma API/intermediate phase? So, how has that trended over the last year or so?

So, I think we all understand that this CDMO part where we are participating with our customers during the clinical phase or regulatory phase or the commercial phase, it's a slow burn. Today, as we speak, and I mentioned in my narrative that we are sitting on about 20 RFPs. Six of them are in late stage phase II or commercial. Right? Last year, I think the number was around 11 or 12. So, you do see consistent growth from last year to now. And some products gain traction, particularly in the chronic space. And new, in addition to that chronic space, since we are looking at peptide fragments, that's a new opportunity that has opened up.

# Asset Turn
Fantastic. So, my next question would be, what is the typical asset turn for our pharma intermediate business? So, is it 1.1, 1.27 What's the asset turn?

Overall, at a company level, because our capacities are fungible, let's not go product category-wise or business segment-wise. But at a company level, I think we have clocked one of the best in the industry north of four.

So, is it that net block or gross block, that four we are talking about? Four would be a net block, I guess.
Net block, yes.

So, at gross block, if CFO sir can respond. So, I am just trying to understand, when you put in the new CAPEX, what kind of numbers would we expect on a gross level?

See, we have a pretty long-term plan in terms of our CAPEX. We will shortly come back with a bigger outlay, which will take care of the future expansion. Our assessment over a period of, if you take the next five years, our asset turn should be somewhere close to 2.5 to 3.
