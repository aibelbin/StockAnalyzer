in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Results section of our report.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the

other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe
that the audit evidence obtained by us, along with the consideration of reports of the other auditors referred

the consolidated financial results.

Manageme and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Consolidated Results

These quarterly consolidated financial results as well as the year to date consolidated financial results
have been prepared on the basis of the consolidated interim financial statements.

The Holding Company's Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and

Independent Auditor’s Report (Continued)

Hexaware Technologies Limited

Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions
of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of each company and for preventing and detecting frauds and
other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate
internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial results that
give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which
have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial results by the Management
and the Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.

In preparing the consolidated financial results, the respective Management and the Board of Directors of
the companies included in the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of each company to continue
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either intends to fiquidate the
company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group is responsible for overseeing
the financial reporting process of each company.

Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Fi cial Results

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial results as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that
an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these consolidated financial results.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial results, whether
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting
a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

— Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

— Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures in the consolidated financial results made by the Management and
Board of Directors.

— Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management's and Board of Directors’ use of the going
concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required
to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial results
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may
cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

— Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial results, including
the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial results represent the underlying transactions
and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

— Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial statements/financial information
of the entities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial results. We are
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of financial

in this audit report.

included in the consolidated financial results of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among
other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any
significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related
safeguards.

Board of India under Regulation 33(8) of the Listing Regulations, to the extent applicable.

are independent of the Company, in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements under the provisions of the Act, and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Standalone Financiai Results

These quarterly financial results as well as the year to date standalone financial results have been
prepared on the basis of the interim financial statements.

The Company's Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation of these

Independent Auditor’s Report (Continued)
Hexaware Technologies Limited

free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the standalone financial results, the Management and the Board of Directors are responsible
for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern and using the going concem basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Results

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial results as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that
an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these standalone financial results.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

— Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial results, whether due
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting
a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s internal control.

— Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures in the standalone financial results made by the Management and
Board of Directors.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management's and Board of Directors’ use of the going
concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial
results or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions
may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern,

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial results, including
the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial results represent the underlying transactions
and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal contro!

that we identify during our audit.
