Accordingly, the unrecognised non-cash adjustments to borrowings arising solely due to exchange rate(s) as of the reporting date

(b) The Company has utilised Euro-denominated export credit insurance-backed Supplier Credits in respect of capital goods, to be repaid in instalments over ten years. While EUR/INR exchange rates were seen to be generally range-bound up to March 2025, due to global movements a steep rise of 8.5% during the quarter in the EUR/INR exchange rate has impacted the carrying value Of the said Euro-denominated borrowings and accordingly the Company is required to provide a loss of INR 741.80 lacs in its Standalone statement of Profit & Loss Account;

(c) It is prudent to point out that over the long-term tenure of the borrowings and there settlement, these fluctuations may not be permanent and could potentially reverse or adjust as part of normal financial trends.
