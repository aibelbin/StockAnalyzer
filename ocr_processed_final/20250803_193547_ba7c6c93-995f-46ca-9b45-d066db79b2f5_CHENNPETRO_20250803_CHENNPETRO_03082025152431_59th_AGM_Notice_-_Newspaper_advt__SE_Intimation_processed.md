No complaints yet on Bihar draft roll from parties: EC

Commission to issue new EPIC cards to electors after special revision of rolls; it opens special camps to help people file objections, and shares list of excluded names with political parties

Sreeparna Chakrabarty
NEW DELHI

day after the publication of the draft electoral rolls following the special intense revision (SIR) in Bihar, the Election Commission on Saturday said all eligible voters would be given new elector photo identity cards (EPIC). Hence, they should provide new photographs by September 1 when the deadline to file claims and objections ends, it said.

The commission said that in the 24 hours - from 3 p.m. on Friday to 3 p.m. on Saturday — since the publication of the draft rolls, no claims were filed by political parties regarding inclusion in, or exclusion from, the rolls.

By the draft rolls, the number of voters in Bihar had dropped by 65 lakh from those on the electoral list prior to the revision.

The draft rolls of the

As per the draft roll published on Friday, the number of voters in Bihar had dropped by 65 lakh. SHASHI SHEKHAR KASHYAP

90,712 polling booths in all
243 Assembly constituencies and the list of those electors whose names were present on the electoral rolls till June 24 but not there on the draft have been shared with all the political parties for verification, the EC said in a statement here.

The 12 political parties on the ground in Bihar have 1.6 lakh booth-level agents (BLAs), nominated by their district presidents.

Details online
Apart from this, any elector of Bihar can check his name on the draft electoral rolls by filling his EPIC number directly on the link https://vo- ters.eci.gov.in The voter can also file his claim or objection for addition or deletion of his name.

The poll body said that to make this process easy, special camps had been opened in all block-cum-circle offices and urban local body municipal offices from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on all days up to September 1. In addition to this, advertisements have been given in newspapers and on television and social media.

A special campaign was organised on August 1 and 2 for the addition of names of young electors who turned 18 or will attain that age from July 1 to October 1. As of now, 3,223 young electors have filled the requisite forms.

The commission has decided to double the annual remuneration of BLOs, and also enhanced the remuneration of BLO supervisors involved in the preparation and revision of electoral rolls. The last such revision was done in 2015. Also, an honorarium has been provided for electoral registration officers and assistant electoral registration officers for the first time.

Name is missing on draft roll, says Tejashwi; EC counters with extract

Amit Bhelari
Sreeparna Chakrabart
PATNA/NEW DELHI

Tejashwi Yadav, Leader of the Opposition in the Bihar Assembly, raked up a controversy on Saturday, just a day after the draft electoral rolls of the State were published, saying his name was missing from the list.

The Election Commission (EC) said the former Deputy Chief Minister was making “baseless” claims, and furnished the extract of the draft roll in which his name is present.

However, confusion prevailed over the fact that the EPIC number quoted by Mr. Yadav was different from the one which the commission gave him on the list it showed. While Mr. Yadav said he voted in the Lok Sabha election in 2024 using the voter ID card having the number RAB2916120, which is now missing from the draft rolls, the EC list shows the number as RABO456228.

EC sources in Delhi said that Mr. Yadav had used EPIC no. RABO456228 for filing his nomination papers on affidavit in the 2020 Assembly election and he was listed with this number even on the 2015 electoral roll. The sources said the other EPIC id RAB2916120 had been found to be non-existent after checking records of more than 10 years.

“No records have been found for the second EPIC number yet. It is highly likely that the second EPIC was never made through official channel and further inquiries are on to understand the reality of the second EPIC number, whether that is a forged document,” a source told The Hindu.

Both the EPIC cards bear the same address.

Mr. Yadav is a voter in the Digha Assembly constituency and represents the Raghopur Assembly seat.
In the current draft roll published on Friday, his name is listed in polling station number 204, Library Building of Bihar Animal Science University, at serial number 416.

Addressing a press conference in Patna, Mr. Yadav said, “You all can see that my name is not found on the EC website. If this is the thing with the Leader of the Opposition, then just think about the common man. What kind of difficulties they must be facing to provide the details and to register their name on the draft list,’ he said.

Patna District Magistrate Thiyagarajan S.M’s office issued a press statement saying that an investigation was conducted by the district administration and it was clear that Mr. Yadav’s name is on the draft rolls.

The DM’s office also shared Mr. Yadav’s 2020 Assembly election affidavit. “In the Bihar Assembly Election, 2020, the Leader of Opposition has mentioned the above EPIC number in his affidavit. It can be seen at serial number 511 in the attached electoral roll,” it said.

Despite the clarification, Mr. Yadav repeated the allegation when he attended a public event in Patna.

“After the chaos, the EC is saying that my name is there on the draft list but the EPIC number is different. EPIC number cannot be changed and it only happens when you delete your name from the present State and add it in another State,” the RJD leader said.Here is the reformatted text in markdown:

# blast case: Pragya Singh Thakur Press Trust of India MUMBAL Former BJP MP Pragya
Singh Thakur, who was recently acquitted in the September 2008 Malegaon
blast case, on Saturday alleged that the officers probing the case had tortured her and asked her to name several persons, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

She claimed she had put all this in writing.

However, Ms. Thakur’s claim found no mention in the 1,036-page judgment of the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court, which acquitted all seven accused in the case on July 31, almost 17 years after six persons were killed in the bomb blast in the north Maharashtra city on September 29, 2008. It criticised the probe agency for presenting what it called “inconclusive”, “unreliable” and “legally inadmissible” evidence.

The former Bhopal MP made the allegation while speaking to reporters outside the Mumbai sessions court, where she completed her surety formalities.

“They (officers) told me to take PM Modi’s name, as I was staying in Surat (Gujarat),” Ms. Thakur said. She added that the officers threatened to torture her unless she named several persons such as “Bhagwat (apparent reference to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat) and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath”.

“But I did not take anyone’s name as I did not want to lie,” she told reporters.

The BJP leader alleged that she was detained illegally in a hospital where she had fainted and her lungs had collapsed.

“IT am writing my story in which I will mention all this. The truth will come out. This is a victory of religion, a victory of Sanatana dharma, and a victory of Hindutva,” she said.

Notably, special judge A.K. Lahoti in his July 31 judgment had dismissed Ms. Thakur’s claims of torture and ill-treatment, stating that no evidence was presented to support her claims.

The court had also referred to a Supreme Court order of 2011 rejecting her claims of illegal custody, torture and detention. The trial court further said that Ms. Thakur had not made any complaint when she was produced for remand after her arrest.

‘No evidence of torture’

“There is no evidence (of torture and ill-treatment) brought to my notice and hence, I am not inclined to accept the submission,” stated the special judge.

He had acknowledged the “agony, frustration, and trauma” caused by the fact that a heinous crime had gone unpunished.

“However, the law does not permit courts to convict an accused solely on the basis of moral conviction or suspicion... The more serious the offence, the higher the standard of proof required. Admittedly, in the present case, there is no reliable, cogent and acceptable evidence on record... to warrant the conviction,” he said.

# EC wants to take away vote from minorities, says Kharge

The Hindu Bureau
NEW DELHI

Amid the ongoing row over the special intensive revision of electoral rolls in Bihar, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Saturday alleged that the Election Commission had become a “puppet” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He added that the draft voter list published in Bihar indicated that as many as 65 lakh voters could be disenfranchised.

Mr. Kharge, who was addressing the All India Congress Committee’s annual legal conclave here on Saturday, added that the EC “wants to take away” the voting rights of all the poor, marginalised and minorities, who would otherwise vote for the Congress as they were “fed up” with BJP’s rule. “Let them vote for whoever they want to,” he said.

At the event titled “Constitutional challenges - perspectives and pathways”, in addition to Mr. Kharge and Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi, senior leaders like Abhishiek Manu Singhvi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, and K.C. Venugopal spoke.

“The soul of India is enshrined in the Constitution. It is the strength of every citizen, their right to move forward and live with dignity. We will protect the Constitution at all costs,” Mr. Kharge said.

# BJP deletes controversial post on nuns after backlash

The Hindu Bureau
RAIPUR

A cartoon posted by the Bharatiya Janata Party in Chhattisgarh on the social media platform X which referred to the controversy over the arrest of two Christian nuns in the State, resulted in a backlash, forcing the party to delete the post on Saturday.

The cartoon, depicting Congress leaders such as Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, and K.C. Venugopal bowing to nuns and as well-wishers of those indulging in human trafficking and religious conversions, was posted and deleted in quick succession on Saturday morning after some users said it mocked Christianity.

The deleted cartoon prompted a strong rebuttal from the Opposition Congress in the State. The party said the BJP had been forced to delete the post fearing electoral losses in Kerala.
