# 2034, FAX: 2781 2091 M. ANANDAM & CO., CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS
independent Auditor’s Review Report on the Quarterly Consolidated Unaudited Financial Results of the Company Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015

## Review Report to the Board of Directors
Balaji Amines Limited

1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results of Balaji Amines Limited (“the Holding Company”) and its subsidiary, Balaji Speciality Chemicals Limited (the Holding Company and its subsidiary together referred to as “the Group”) for the quarter ended 30 June, 2025 (“the Statement”), being submitted by the Holding Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (the “LODR Regulations”).

2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Holding Company’s Management and approved by the Holding Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review.

3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

4. The Statement includes the results of the subsidiary, Balaji Speciality Chemicals Limited.

5. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited consolidated financial results, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standard and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
