# LIMITED infoengg@lloyds.in (Formerly known as Lloyds Steels Industries Limited) LEWL Strengthens Strategic Alliance with Fincantieri; Adds New Products to Defence & Marine Line-up

## Mumbai, July 24, 2025:

Lloyds Engineering Works Ltd (LEWL) has further enhanced its product offerings in the defence and naval sector by strengthening its strategic technological partnership with FINCANTIERI S.p.A, one of the world's leading shipbuilding groups based in Italy.

The collaboration builds on an existing agreement between the two companies for the joint design and production of Advanced Steering Gear Systems, Fin Stabilizer Systems, Azimuthal Thrusters, and Transversal Tunnel Thrusters. This partnership is now being deepened with the addition of two crucial marine propulsion systems:

* Controllable Pitch Propeller (CPP) Systems
* Shafting Systems

CPP systems enable real-time adjustment of blade pitch during operation, providing precise thrust control, enhanced fuel efficiency, and superior maneuverability – crucial for modern naval vessels. Shafting systems ensure efficient power transfer from the main engine to the propeller with high accuracy and low acoustic signature, vital for stealth operations.

Through this strategic alliance, LEWL will develop and manufacture these advanced propulsion systems indigenously – traditionally reliant on imports – making it one of the first Indian companies to do so. This marks a significant milestone in LEWL's contribution to the Government's Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative and markedly improves India's naval self-sufficiency.

The partnership will facilitate access to advanced engineering expertise from FINCANTIERI S.p.A, enabling LEWL to establish state-of-the-art manufacturing and testing infrastructure, nurture a skilled workforce, and become a preferred supplier for both domestic and international naval programmes.

This development coincides with LEWL experiencing strong growth in its defence engineering segment. As of FY25, the company's current order book in the defence sector exceeds Rs 100 Crs, with increasing prospects for future contracts. This collaboration aids in long-term revenue growth and expansion of LEWL's defence sector

Mr. Shreekrishna Gupta, Executive Director of Lloyds Engineering Works Limited, stated:

"This extended partnership with FINCANTIERI S.p.A represents a transformative opportunity for Lloyds Engineering. By localising critical propulsion technologies such as CPP and shafting systems, we are not only addressing a vital capability gap in India's naval ecosystem but also laying the groundwork for sustainable long-term growth. This collaboration enhances our position as a key player in India's defence manufacturing landscape and accelerates our ambition to become a leading supplier in defence and marine systems."
